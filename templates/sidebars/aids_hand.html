        <h5>HIVâ€™s impact on the brain</h5>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>In the earliest years of the epidemic, before drugs to treat HIV,
            dementia was common among AIDS patients. Roughly a third would experience
            severe cognitive decline before they died.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>After HIV became a treatable disease, rates of dementia fell
            dramatically. Today, some studies show that less than 5 percent of all
            HIV-infected people develop HIV-associated dementia. People whose infection
            is well controlled with drugs are less likely to develop dementia, but drug
            therapy doesn&rsquo;t guarantee protection.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>Other, milder cognition problems are still prevalent. These
            impairments, along with dementia, are known collectively as</span>
            <span>HIV</span><span>-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND).</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>The less severe types of HAND produce symptoms that may not even be
            noticeable to patients, their friends or family. Some people experience
            problems with memory, language and decision-making skills, but are still
            able to function day to day.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>Studies suggest roughly half of all people with HIV have some
            cognitive impairment. Rates are higher among people who have been
            HIV-positive for 10 or more years.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>Other than HIV antiretroviral therapy, there are no drugs to treat
            HAND specifically.</span>
