        <h5>Pets a crucial lifeline for the lonely</h5>
        <p>When Kevin VandenBergh&rsquo;s cat, Truman, died, he stopped taking his AIDS drugs for a month, until routine blood work showed that his immune system was taking a hit and he reluctantly started the drugs again. Kevin&rsquo;s reaction isn&rsquo;t unusual among long-term survivors.</p>

        <p>Men who lost countless friends and loved ones to AIDS – in some cases, almost their entire social network – sometimes struggle to form bonds with new people. Pets can play an especially vital role in lives lived largely in isolation. Losing those pets can be devastating.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;If everyone you knew vanished, and the only thing there with unrequited love, saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m still here and I love you,&rsquo; was your pets? That&rsquo;s a big deal,&rdquo; said Kathy Gervais, a veterinarian with the San Francisco SPCA who works with Pets Are Wonderful Support, a nonprofit that helps AIDS patients and others care for their animals.</p>

        <p>The crucial role of pets was recognized early in the epidemic, when PAWS was formed to help convince doctors that it was safe for AIDS patients to keep cats, dogs and other animals. Later, the organization helped care for pets when their owners were hospitalized, and offered financial help for people with AIDS who couldn&rsquo;t afford pet food or veterinary visits.</p>

        <p>Gervais said she used to smuggle dogs and cats into hospitals to visit sick owners. Now, it&rsquo;s well understood that pets can improve the mental and physical well-being of their owners.</p>

        <p>Dog owners have to take their pets outside for walks every day, which means they get exercise and the possibility of social interaction. Cats can simply force someone out of bed every morning, or provide the comfort of a warm, living presence.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Truman provided so much joy and so much meaning and intimacy and purpose,&rdquo; Kevin said. &ldquo;I might not be able to do anything well, but I could be a really good dad to Truman. That was enough.&rdquo;</p>
