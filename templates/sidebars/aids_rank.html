        <h5>Is any city prepared to serve aging survivors?</h5>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>San Francisco has one of the largest populations of long-term
            survivors in the country, but other cities are facing similar public health
            crises as those living with AIDS get older.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>And though critics note that San Francisco isn&rsquo;t yet providing
            all the support that long-term survivors need to stay healthy, the city is
            still ahead of</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;</span><span>many other
            places. San Francisco, at least, has identified that long-term survivors are
            living here and need special services like help with housing and health
            care.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>So far, San Francisco and New York City are the only two major urban
            areas to address the problem and get buy-in from government and nonprofit
            agencies, said Hanna Tessama, who works with AIDS Community Research
            Initiative of America, a New York group that is raising national awareness
            of HIV and aging issues.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of frustration&rdquo; in San Francisco, she
            said. &ldquo;But at least they acknowledge there are a lot of survivors,
            they&rsquo;ve acknowledged there&rsquo;s a need for services. Many cities
            haven&rsquo;t even acknowledged this is a problem, or haven&rsquo;t gotten
            any commitment to do anything.&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>Communities in Southern states in particular are in trouble, she
            added. There are large pockets of long-term survi</span><span class=
            "c5">vors in</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Florida, Louisiana, Georgia,
            Mississippi and east Texas, for</span> <span>example, and almost no
            discussion of how to help them.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener said San Francisco is
            &ldquo;definitely behind&rdquo; on meeting the needs of long-term survivors.
            The city has a responsibility, he said, to see to those needs and lead other
            communities to do the same.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0">
            <span>&ldquo;We were always in the vanguard in terms of making a commitment,
            making the financial investment, being on the cutting edge,&rdquo; Wiener
            said. &ldquo;We have to continue to do that.&rdquo;</span>
