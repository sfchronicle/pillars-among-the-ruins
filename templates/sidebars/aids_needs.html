        <h5>A first step: Identifying AIDS survivorsâ€™ needs</h5>
        <p class="c1">
            <span>Perhaps the largest barrier toward providing services for long-term
            AIDS survivors is not understanding precisely what they need. To that end,
            San Francisco and New York City have done &ldquo;needs assessment&rdquo;
            surveys of varying sizes and scientific relevance.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span>The first surveys unveiled widespread mental health problems,
            especially related to isolation, along with concerns over housing and
            long-term finances. Those surveys need to be updated now, researchers say,
            and they should be more inclusive, tapping into the growing and diverse
            population of older people with HIV or AIDS.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span>2006: The first study, in New York, was done by the AIDS Community
            Research Initiative of America (ACRIA). It surveyed more than 900 older
            adults with HIV. The study identified the aging population as &ldquo;growing
            and invisible&rdquo; and identified isolation and health complications as
            major areas of concern.</span> <span>The study, called Research on Older
            Adults with HIV (ROAH), is available</span> <span class="c2"><a class="c4"

        <p class="c1">
            <span>2009: The Gay Men&rsquo;s Health Crisis (GMHC) in New York studied the
            needs of 180 older men with HIV and the services they were currently
            using.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span>2010: San Francisco&rsquo;s first paper on HIV and aging was an
            analysis of focus group reports and local and national epidemiological data.
            It was not a direct survey of long-term survivors. The report suggested that
            San Francisco devote &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; focus to identifying and
            serving long-term survivors.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span>2013: San Francisco&rsquo;s first survey of older people with HIV was
            released. The report, which largely replicated the earlier GMHC paper,
            surveyed 160 people in San Francisco, as well as Marin and San Mateo
            counties. The survey identified isolation, high cost of living and housing
            as major concerns. The survey also found that more than a third of
            participants didn&rsquo;t know what services were available to them, or
            found those services too expensive. T</span><span>he survey results are

            <span>2016: ACRIA is planning a follow-up survey to its 2006 study.
            They&rsquo;d like to survey about 250 people in San Francisco in addition to
            New York. They also plan to survey people in Oakland, Chicago, Atlanta and
            other metropolitan areas with large populations of long-term
            survivors.</span> <span>The new surveys still need funding -- about $125,000
            in San Francisco. If ACRIA gets the money, the San Francisco survey could
            start this summer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;2016</span><span>.</span>
