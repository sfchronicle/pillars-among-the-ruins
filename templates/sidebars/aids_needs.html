        <p class="c0"><span>Perhaps the largest barrier toward providing services for long-term survivors is not understanding precisely what they need. To that end, San Francisco and New York City have done &ldquo;needs assessment&rdquo; surveys of varying sizes and scientific relevance.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">The first surveys unveiled widespread mental health problems, especially related to isolation, along with concerns over housing and long-term finances. Those surveys need to be updated now, researchers say, and they should be more inclusive, tapping into the growing and diverse population of older people with HIV or AIDS.</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c2">Add a line here briefly saying something about what has been/still needs to be determined?</span>

        <p class="c0"><span>2006: The first study, in New York, was done by the AIDS Community Research Initiative of America (ACRIA). It surveyed more than 900 older adults with HIV. The study identified the aging population as &ldquo;growing and invisible&rdquo; and identified isolation and health complications as major areas of concern. </span><span class="c5">The study, called Research on Older Adults with HIV (ROAH), is available </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.acria.org/research-study&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1454548193531000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbV_rhLSubFKcHL6eeqA_ZuIWtVg">online</a></span><span class="c5">.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span>2009: The Gay Men&rsquo;s Health Crisis (GMHC) in New York studied the needs of 180 older men with HIV and the services they were currently using.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span>2010: San Francisco&rsquo;s first paper on HIV and aging was an analysis of focus group reports and local and national epidemiological data. It was not a direct survey of long-term survivors. The report suggested that San Francisco devote &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; focus to identifying and serving long-term survivors.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span>2013: San Francisco&rsquo;s first survey of older people with HIV was released. The report, which largely replicated the earlier GMHC paper, surveyed 160 people in San Francisco, as well as Marin and San Mateo counties. The survey identified isolation, high cost of living and housing as major concerns among participants. The survey also found that more than a third of participants didn&rsquo;t know what services were available to them, or found those services too expensive. T</span><span class="c5">he survey results are available </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sfcarecouncil.org/Documents/docs/Loren-%2520Upload%2520to%2520website/HIV_%26_Aging_Paper.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1454548193533000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHirqMslgjugmG08IwdvQXe_5vR3g">online</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(PDF).</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span>2016: ACRIA is planning a second survey to follow up its 2006 study. This time, they&rsquo;d like to survey about 250 people in San Francisco in addition to New York. They also plan to survey people in Oakland, Chicago, Atlanta and other metropolitan areas with large populations of long-term survivors. </span><span class="c5">The new surveys still need funding -- about $125,000 in San Francisco. If ACRIA gets the money, the San Francisco survey could start in summer 2016.</span>
