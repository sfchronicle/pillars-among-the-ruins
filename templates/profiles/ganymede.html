        <h2>Jesus Guillen</h2>
        <p>When Jesus Guillen meets someone for the first time, he’s keenly aware of his appear- ance – not just his hair, often dyed a rich pink or platinum blond, or how he’s dressed or the lines that are starting to edge in on his decep- tively young-looking face. He smiles and he listens and he holds himself somehow both still and fluid, like a dancer. He doesn’t look like a man in pain.</p>
