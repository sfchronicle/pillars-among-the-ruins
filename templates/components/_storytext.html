    <span><span class="dropcap">U</span>nder the bed in his Castro apartment, Kevin VandenBergh hides the source of his greatest pride. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Inside a clear plastic bin are dozens of folders containing the body of his academic work. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He fans the folders across his comforter, leafing through faded typewritten pages to find one of the last papers he wrote. He begins to read aloud, marveling a bit at his own words. He was a talented writer. No denying it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>And then, suddenly, he&rsquo;s angry.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;This is who you were, Kevin,&rdquo; he says, his voice hard and unforgiving. &ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Thirty years ago, Kevin was</span>
    <span>&nbsp;a psychology student at the University of Chicago. His instructors lavished him with praise. In the margins and on the backs of his papers they scrawled notes </span>
    <span class="c3">&ndash;</span>
    <span>&nbsp;he was the best student they&rsquo;d seen in years, so gifted that he was almost beyond critique. With his talent he could excel in graduate school, they said. He could look toward a career in academics or writing, to an exceptional future.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He started to believe them.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>A year after he graduated he tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS. It was, he understood, a death sentence.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;In 1987, my life skittered off,&rdquo; Kevin said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a disaster ever since.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Kevin is 56 now. He doesn&rsquo;t work. He rarely writes. He spends hours alone in his apartment high above Market Street. Sometimes he&rsquo;s there all day.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He avoids looking in that box under his bed. He tries not to think about the man he could have been, about his decision to give up.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In one of the papers he kept </span>
    <span class="c3">&ndash;</span>
    <span>&nbsp;a speech he gave at his high school graduation </span>
    <span class="c3">&ndash;</span>
    <span>&nbsp;he wrote that every man is responsible for his own happiness, for choosing to seek joy. Kevin wants to be that man, but he doesn&rsquo;t know how.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He doesn&rsquo;t know why he lived and so many others did not. </span>

    <span>eter Greene was 22 when he hitchhiked to San Francisco in 1977, just after college. He was Mr. Gay Colorado, a title he won in a barroom stunt, and with his Tom Selleck mustache and toned, athletic body, Peter was confident and fearless.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He arrived in a city exploding with political and cultural gay life, host to a great gay migration that drove thousands of young men to San Francisco in the 1970s, building a boomtown in the Castro District.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>AIDS was then an invisible, not-yet-deadly presence in San Francisco. The virus circulated among people who didn&rsquo;t know it existed, and it spread widely among men exploring an unprecedented sexual freedom.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>T</span>
    <span>he 1970s were a thrilling time for gay rights, and a new, live-out-loud generation was coalescing around political touchstones &ndash; the Stonewall Riots in New York City, attacks on gay rights in California and the rest of the country, and in San
        Francisco, the killing of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay supervisor, and Mayor George Moscone in 1978.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>For Peter and other young gay men, so many of whom came to San Francisco from parts of the country where living openly was out of the question, the Castro and the rest of the city were a feast of freedom and opportunity. Men could hold hands on the
        sidewalk or flirt openly in gay bars with clear glass windows facing the street. In the bathhouses they could have sex with whomever, whenever, free of judgment or shame.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>That all abruptly ended when the deaths began. Nine people died of AIDS in 1981. By 1992, 30 people were dying a week. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>...</span>

    <span>T</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" name="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup>
    <span>he human immunodeficiency virus causes AIDS &ndash; an acronym for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome &ndash; by killing a type of immune cell called a T-cell, leaving the body vulnerable to other diseases.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Before drugs were developed to treat HIV and stop AIDS, men who tested positive expected to die. Their doctors often did little to discourage that thinking. Young men were told to make the most of what would likely be their final months or years.</span>
    <span
    class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter thinks he was infected within a few years of his arrival in San Francisco. By the time he tested positive in 1985, &ldquo;the party was over,&rdquo; he said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>A year earlier Peter had started a travel agency with a friend, Jonathan Klein. The two had become close, though not romantic, on a gay bike tour of China. For a few years, theirs was a joyful, flourishing business. As the AIDS epidemic grew, they
        charted final trips for young clients who would need oxygen or wheelchairs to travel. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In the Castro, Peter watched young men, their bodies stooped and wasted, totter along the sidewalks leaning on canes. His doctor died of AIDS just months after Peter tested positive. Early in the epidemic, he lost men he knew from high school and
        college, who returned home to their parents or died in their adopted cities, friends at their bedside.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter&rsquo;s lover got sick, too. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter became obsessed with keeping himself alive. He</span>
    <span>&nbsp;signed up for every clinical trial that would take him, grabbed for every experimental drug.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But as hard as Peter fought, death still felt inevitable. In 1994, he cashed out of the </span>
    <span>travel agency. </span>
    <span>Peter thought if AIDS was going to kill him, he might as well check out on his terms.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d died when they told me, I would have died a wealthy man with a successful business,&rdquo; he said. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Faced with death, Peter made decisions that had repercussions he never could have anticipated, for a future that he was sure wouldn&rsquo;t exist. Now he approaches old age with no sa</span>
    <span>vings and little income &ndash; and no way to afford the city he considers home.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter is 61, his beard flecked with gray. His eyes are a striking, youthful blue, and his smile comes easy and natural. But sometimes he looks into the distance and his face falls, his grief plain.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter has fought AIDS for half his life, and by the most primitive measures, he&rsquo;s won. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But he buried most of his friends, people he laughed and sang and danced with, who shared some of his brightest memories. He buried the man he loved.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the luckiest unlucky person in the world,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be the last man standing.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>...</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede sailed into San Francisco Bay with his lover, Alain Auras, in the summer of 1984.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Over the next decade, he tended to more deaths than he could count. And when the losses finally became too much, it nearly killed him.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede, 59, was born Jeffrey Andrews. While living in San Diego in his early 20s, he attended a lecture on Jungian psychology, </span>
    <span class="c0">and it was there he learned about the archetype of Ganymede, a hero in Greek mythology who stood for love unbound by gender. Ganymede identified so strongly with the character that he changed his name.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In the Bay Area, he further explored his fascination with the union of sex and spirituality, and he built up a community of queer men and women who shared his interests. That community became family, and that family was eviscerated by AIDS.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He and Alain tested positive for HIV in 1985, the same year they bought a house in the Oakland Hills. But Alain quickly got sick while Ganymede remained healthy.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I spoon-fed him water on the day he died,&rdquo; Ganymede said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Alain died at the peak of the epidemic, in 1992. Later, as the deaths finally slowed and the wave of suffering started to recede, Ganymede fell in love again. His new partner, Steven Brown, was also HIV positive.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede convinced Steven to leave his Twin Peaks apartment and move to Oakland, where they could heal far from the battlefield San Francisco had become.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>They lived with two cats and with more memories than their home could hold. Steven hoarded books and artwork, and Ganymede had mementos from those he&rsquo;d lost, pagan sculptures Alain crafted </span>
    <span>when he turned to art in his illness.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede wanted the isolation. He wanted the quiet and solitude of their partnership. In their home in the hills, amid their trees and gardens, Ganymede pulled away from what remained of his family, from the friends he&rsquo;d relied on through the
        worst years. He and Steven leaned into each other.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;We were pillars standing amidst the ruins,&rdquo; Ganymede said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>That was what they told each other.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But even after there was hope &ndash; after HIV became a treatable, survivable disease &ndash; AIDS could still grab hold. In 1995, scientists finally produced drugs that could stop HIV and prevent or even reverse the course of AIDS.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The drugs came too late for Steven. The virus in his body was too deeply rooted, his immune system too abused. Losing Alain had been terrible, but Steven&rsquo;s death in 2006 broke Ganymede&rsquo;s heart in a way that felt beyond repair. He&rsquo;d
        allowed himself to feel safe with Steven. He thought they&rsquo;d survived.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede pulled further away from his friends. He&rsquo;d quit </span>
    <span>his job </span>
    <span>as a software engineer </span>
    <span>to take care of Steven, so he&rsquo;d lost that structure, too. Their cat died, and then Ganymede&rsquo;s mother died. He&rsquo;d never felt so alone.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to be here with so much sorrow and loss, and not just Steven, but the whole legacy of sorrow and loss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I felt resentful that they all left, they got to be free of their pain.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede stopped taking the drugs that were holding AIDS at bay, and braced against whatever future might come.</span>
</p>

    <span>Kevin </span>
    <span>VandenBergh</span>
    <span>&nbsp;was from a working-class family in Chicago and even an undergraduate degree had seemed a grand reach. But he was thinking about a future in academia &ndash; the dean of the psychology department at the University of Chicago was trying to lure
        him into a PhD program.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He tested positive at 26, before he had a chance to apply.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;And I thought, why bother?&rdquo; Kevin said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Instead, he got a job as an entry-level computer programmer. He figured he&rsquo;d be dead by 35, and a job would provide him with health insurance and a steady income in the meantime.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The work was tedious and the office politics a constant source of anxiety. When he began experiencing odd neurological symptoms &ndash; shaky hands, a stiff, awkward walk &ndash; it was almost a relief.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>His doctor ran tests, then called Kevin at work to tell him he might have an AIDS-related infection in his brain. Kevin went immediately to his boss&rsquo;s office and quit.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>That was January 1994, and Kevin has been on disability ever since.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Now he lives in regret. He moved to San Francisco with a boyfriend shortly after leaving his job, and since then he&rsquo;s mostly been unemployed and alone. If he&rsquo;d thought there was a chance he would outlive AIDS, he might have stayed in school.
        He might have saved for retirement or bought a home.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I was in that mindset,&rdquo; Kevin said. &ldquo;I was preparing all that time to die.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Kevin worries constantly about money. At the moment he has enough to cover his shared rent, food and small indulgences. </span>
    <span>During the five years that he worked, he paid into a disability insurance program.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;But that policy ends in nine years, when he turns 65.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;Then he&rsquo;ll have to live on </span>
    <span>Social Security </span>
    <span>alone, cutting his income nearly in half, to about $1,600 a month. He won&rsquo;t be able to afford his apartment.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>T</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" name="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup>
    <span>housands of long-term survivors in San Francisco are facing a similar deadline. The city</span>
    <span>&nbsp;issued a report </span>
    <span>in last year</span>
    <span>&nbsp;estimating that up to 1,200 people with AIDS are living off of private disability insurance that will expire when they reach retirement age.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;Keeping them in their homes will require money &ndash; up to $19 million over the next five years for rental subsidies.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Earlier this year, Kevin worked up the courage to speak before a Board of Supervisors committee about his money concerns. Months later he wondered if there will be any help for him when he needs it. City leaders seem concerned, but he and his peers
        would be easy to overlook, and to forget.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cohort that is just</span>
    <span>&nbsp;shuffling off stage and will be gone at one point,&rdquo; Kevin said. &ldquo;Then AIDS is over and it&rsquo;s not a big deal.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Kevin knows he should get a job. But if he goes back to work he has to give up the disability checks, and that feels like too big a risk.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;Even if he wanted to work again, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s going to hire me?&rdquo; Kevin said. His computer skills are outdated and he has no recent job experience to put on a resume.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He long ago lost the opportunity to engage in a field he feels passionate about. Now he feels trapped, his decisions already made. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He had only one choice: </span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" name="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup>
    <span>to give up his ambitions. He never even got the chance to fail.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;That was a life that I was supposed to at least try to have,&rdquo; Kevin said, &ldquo;to achieve something I could be proud of.&rdquo;</span>

    <span class="c0">eeply entrenched homophobia slowed federal reaction to the epidemic, allowing HIV to spread practically unfettered. In the first decade, gay rights activists and patient advocates campaigned to make the public aware that AIDS wasn&rsquo;t just a gay
        disease and straight men and women were at risk too. By the end of the 1990s AIDS was widely understood to be a mainstream public health disaster.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">But in San Francisco, it was gay men who were </span>
    <span>&ndash; </span>
    <span class="c0">and still are </span>
    <span>&ndash; </span>
    <span class="c0">most vulnerable to AIDS. And with a large population of men so at risk of infection, San Francisco in the earliest years responded faster and more aggressively to the epidemic than anywhere else in the world.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">Fear and grief were channeled into actions that would have profound, lasting effects as San Francisco learned to take care of its own. A system of care now known as the San Francisco Model emerged.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">T</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" name="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup>
    <span class="c0">he m</span>
    <span class="c0">odel</span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;was a blend of health care and public services that was unique at the time. On the health care side, the model provided not just care but kindness to patients who often were shunned because they were gay and they had a disease that was terrifying.
        San Francisco General Hospital&rsquo;s AIDS wards &ndash; the first of their kind in the country &ndash; were a cornerstone of the model. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">Around the health care services rose a web of nonprofit agencies created by the community itself.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;AIDS was all about aiding each other and not getting aid from the people around us and the country and the government,&rdquo; said Harry Breaux, 70, a member of the city&rsquo;s HIV and Aging Work Group, which is responsible for assessing the
        needs of people growing old with AIDS.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">When drugs to fight HIV and AIDS arrived in 1995, the city was among the first to get patients into care.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>T</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" name="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup>
    <span>he drugs, called antiretrovirals, </span>
    <span>had swift </span>
    <span>impact</span>
    <span>&nbsp;on individuals and on the epidemic at large. </span>
    <span>Deaths from AIDS in San Francisco dropped from nearly 1,500 in 1995 to 424 in 1997. Three years after the drugs came along, the Bay Area Reporter, a gay weekly newspaper, ran a banner headline: &ldquo;No obits.&rdquo; It was the first time the paper
        hadn&rsquo;t had an AIDS death to report in more than 15 years.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Now, 20 years after the first antiretrovirals became available, doctors believe that with drug therapy people with HIV can live a near-normal lifespan. The drugs altered the course and character of an entire epidemic. Suddenly there was hope and optimism.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>T</span>
    <span>he transformation was so fast, so dramatic, that doctors, public health experts and patient advocates only recently realized there would be a community of survivors, and that they would have needs that went beyond just staying alive.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>T</span>
    <span>he discovery and wide distribution of drugs to fight AIDS created a subtle but significant fissure between the greater public and those who had experienced the epidemic firsthand. People started talking more about HIV than AIDS, more about living
        than dying.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But AIDS left lingering wounds for the survivors. The post-drug years proved, at times, only how fragile the plague had left them.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Jesus Guillen, 55, doesn&rsquo;t come across as a man who is alone. He has close friends, people he calls family.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;From time to time he sings at neighborhood talent shows and fundraisers, or visits local fairs and festivals where he dances or takes photos. He volunteers nearly every day with groups trying to draw attention to people aging with AIDS.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But AIDS has left physical and psychological injuries that have raised barriers between Jesus and his loved ones, and isolated him from the rest of the world.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Jesus believed he was going to die after he tested positive for HIV in 1986. He was 26, a naive young man from a small town in Mexico who&rsquo;d come to Los Angeles for a change of pace and to pursue a career in acting and singing. He got tested
        after learning that a man he&rsquo;d slept with not long after coming to the United States had died of AIDS.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Jesus remained mostly healthy for many years. He started antiretroviral therapy in 2000, on the advice of his doctor, and either the drugs or the HIV left him with mild neuropathy &ndash; a numb, tingling sensation in his leg.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But in 2007 he found a lump in his neck and was diagnosed with lymphoma, a type of cancer that has been linked to long-term infection with HIV. The chemotherapy treatment was harsh, likely made worse by his already weakened immune system.</span>

<p class="c1">
    <span>After a year, he knocked back the cancer and avoided a resurgence of AIDS symptoms. But he was anxious all the time. He had trouble sleeping. For years since his cancer, </span>
    <span>he&rsquo;s had a recurring nightmare.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;Every night is the same dream,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to turn on the light and I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>...</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Chronic stress and anxiety are common among AIDS survivors, and some men have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Jesus&rsquo; nightmares, the anxiety, the insomnia &ndash; all are symptoms of PTSD.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The cancer treatment also worsened his neuropathy, contorting it into a chronic pain.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Jesus has an easy, soft smile, and he carries himself like a dancer. His hair is often dyed &ndash; rich pink one day, platinum blond the next &ndash; and his face is unlined and relaxed. But the pain comes through in a tightness around his eyes and,
        most tellingly, the way he rubs his leg, firmly but absently, like he&rsquo;s not aware he&rsquo;s doing it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Nothing alleviates the pain entirely. Some days it drives him to tears.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The pain can be exhausting, sapping his energy and making even dinner with a friend seem impossible. The pain is what&rsquo;s kept him out of work for 10 years.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In the sunny Hayes Valley apartment where he&rsquo;s lived for 15 years, Jesus has built a sanctuary, reflective of his artistic spirit &ndash; his photos and art fill the rooms, along with pieces his mother has brought from Mexico and plants tucked
        into every corner. </span>
    <span>It&rsquo;s just Jesus and his cat, Mija, in the apartment. He doesn&rsquo;t get lonely there. </span>
    <span>But he worries about being alone.</span>
</p>
<p class="c7">
    <span>If Jesus gets sick again &ndash; a return of the cancer or something AIDS-related, or pain that somehow gets worse &ndash; he doesn&rsquo;t know to whom he will turn.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He knows he should have a living will and someone appointed his health care surrogate, to make tough decisions about his care. His mother lives too far away, in Mexico. It seems like too much responsibility to put on a friend, even a very good one.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I keep thinking a partner should do that,&rdquo; Jesus said. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t have a partner now.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>H</span>
    <span>is voice, softly accented and melodic, falters as he goes on. Jesus longs for a life beyond AIDS.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <span>&nbsp;He longs for the opportunity to live larger now.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He wants to work, and to share his art and his music.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He wants to fall in love. To get married. He wants to be seen and embraced.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I like to think I am a good person. I have good things to offer a person,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But definitely I&rsquo;m not a simple person</span>
    <span>.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Isolation is a widespread problem with both psychological and practical complications among long-term survivors. Men without a strong network of close friends have increased risk of depression, anxiety and other mental health problems. And men without
        partners may have less income, making them more vulnerable to financial upsets like losing a low-rent apartment or coping with cost of living increases. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>For some men who suffered extraordinary heartache during the epidemic, </span>
    <span>reaching out and forming new relationships &ndash; romantic or not &ndash; can seem impossible. Even the smallest risk of losing again can feel too dangerous.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>By its very nature, isolation is difficult to quantify. </span>
    <span>Those who are isolated</span>
    <span>&nbsp;often aren&rsquo;t tapped into social groups or services for people with HIV.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>They don&rsquo;t have jobs that might offer some structure. Their parents may be dead, or they severed ties long ago. They don&rsquo;t have children. Their connections are tenuous and brief &ndash; phone calls with the handful of friends who survived
        with them, an hour a week with a therapist, an appointment with their doctor.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Of the work being done to improve services for long-term survivors, overcoming isolation has drawn the most attention and resources.</span>

<p class="c1">
    <span>The San Francisco AIDS Foundation</span>
    <span>&nbsp;in April 2014 started the 50-Plus Network for older gay men. The members meet weekly for dinner and to talk about their pasts and their plans for the future. For some, it&rsquo;s their only shared meal of the week. A handful of other informal
        support groups have</span>
    <span>&nbsp;sprung up, but they still aren&rsquo;t close to reaching everyone who needs</span>
    <span>&nbsp;help.</span>

<p class="c1">
    <span>The view from Kevin VandenBergh&rsquo;s wide-windowed apartment extends to downtown San Francisco, over the dips and swells of the city, and across the bay to the Oakland Hills. On a clear day Mount Diablo juts over the distant skyline. Kevin is hardly
        aware of it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The outside world is a place he doesn&rsquo;t explore with confidence. His social life is thin, pinched into a weekly lunch with an ex-boyfriend, the staff he sees at the animal shelter where he sometimes volunteers, meetings with the </span>
    <span>50-Plus Network</span>
    <span>&nbsp;if he can work up the will and the energy to leave his apartment. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In his living room, the only obvious signs of his presence are a stack of DVDs of his favorite TV shows and mementos of his cat, Truman, who died two years ago. On a shelf sits a framed photo of Truman, and in a corner stands Truman&rsquo;s tall,
        carpeted play structure.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Being out of work for 20 years, and alone for much of that time, has made him awkward and tense in social situations, when he does venture out. He overshares, only to withdraw when he becomes self-conscious. He fidgets, his hands in constant motion
        </span>
    <span>&ndash;</span>
    <span>&nbsp;rubbing his thighs, knotting his fingers, tugging at his clothes.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>When Kevin meets new people, he dreads the moment when they ask what he does for a living, and he has to say nothing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I feel like my life </span>
    <span>has been a total waste,&rdquo; Kevin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve accomplished nothing. I have nothing to offer.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Kevin has battled depression for most of his adult life. It has clouded his actions and distorted his perspective. It&rsquo;s made AIDS that much more of a burden. Though he gets free therapy through a psychiatry clinic at California Pacific Medical
        Center, it isn&rsquo;t helping, he says.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>After he tested positive for HIV, Kevin constantly feared rejection. He felt indebted to potential partners who accepted him, even if there wasn&rsquo;t a spark of romance</span>
    <span>.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;Now, dating men his age can feel like a minefield. Everyone&rsquo;s damaged. Everyone carries baggage. So he&rsquo;s largely avoided it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>T</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" name="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup>
    <span>he full depth of his isolation became obvious after Truman died. </span>
    <span>For 10 years Truman had been his closest companion. He talked to the cat constantly and shared his life with him. When Kevin was so depressed he stayed in bed day after day, Truman stayed with him, at his side.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;He was the love of my life, the most intimate relationship I have ever had,&rdquo; Kevin said. &ldquo;He was my reason for living.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Truman&rsquo;s death hit Kevin harder than any friend he&rsquo;d lost during the epidemic. When Truman died, Kevin started thinking seriously about suicide. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He made a plan.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">Peter Greene had co-owned his Castro travel agency for almost a decade when he sold his share to his business partner. The agency, called Now, Voyager, remained important to him even after he gave it up, and he stayed close to Jonathan Klein.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter lived in an apartment over the business, and he&rsquo;d sometimes work there when Jonathan was out of town or pop down to answer phones. He and Jonathan were friends outside the business too. They&rsquo;d always shared a love of travel and adventure,
        even after the partnership ended.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>On an early spring night in 2013, Peter, Jonathan and a group of friends went to the Castro Theater to watch the comedian Coco Peru. They were in good spirits after the show, and not ready to let the evening end, they walked to Peter&rsquo;s apartment
        to finish the evening.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>They joked and laughed at old familiar stories. It was Peter&rsquo;s home, but Jonathan played host, spreading out cheese and crackers, decanting the wine and keeping everyone&rsquo;s glasses filled. Jonathan had been under enormous stress lately.
        He&rsquo;d lost his apartment when the building was sold and was forced to move out of the city. He was worried about losing Now, Voyager.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But on that night he was gracious and witty, his old charming self. His friends thought it was good to see.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>No one knew he was saying goodbye.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d already written his suicide note,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;He already knew what he was going to do.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Two days later, on a cold morning in April, Jonathan, 61, drove to the Golden Gate Bridge and parked. He walked </span>
    <span>out on</span>
    <span>&nbsp;the span and jumped to his death.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>...</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter and Jonathan tested positive for HIV at the same time, in 1985. It wasn&rsquo;t AIDS that killed Jonathan, and it wasn&rsquo;t AIDS, at least not entirely, that drove him to suicide. Until he fell to depression and a host of anxieties, he was
        one of the survivors.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Not long after Jonathan&rsquo;s death, Peter lost his own apartment when the building was sold. The travel agency &ndash; which Jonathan had left to Peter &ndash; also was displaced and looked like it might have to close. Peter, like Jonathan, had
        to leave San Francisco, his home for more than 30 years.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter doesn&rsquo;t entertain thoughts of suicide. He doesn&rsquo;t suffer the same clinical depression that dogged Jonathan for most of his life. But like Jonathan, Peter is scared and he doesn&rsquo;t see any easy answers.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;It was the perfect storm for him,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;Sometimes it feels that way for me.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Suicide has been a killer of people with AIDS since the beginning. In those horrifying early years, men would hoard drugs to end things themselves before AIDS killed them. Some men would throw themselves farewell parties.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But the suicides didn&rsquo;t stop after the antiretrovirals came along and AIDS no longer meant certain death.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <span>Four percent of people with HIV or AIDS who died in the city between 2009 and 2012 killed themselves</span>
    <span class="c0">; nationwide, suicide accounts for about 1.5 percent of all deaths.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for survivors to stop taking their medication &ndash; for days or weeks or months &ndash; in what may not be an overt death wish so much as a rebellion against living.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">Seven years ago, Mick Robinson turned 50. It was a tough birthday </span>
    <span>&ndash;</span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;one that made him think he&rsquo;d wasted too much of his life, let it pass recklessly by.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">He&rsquo;d suffered through cycles of addiction and depression that had lasted almost his whole life. Around that birthday, Mick stopped taking his HIV medication.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Mick had long counted on dying from AIDS. He </span>
    <span>was diagnosed </span><sup><a href="#cmnt11" name="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup>
    <span>while in a psych ward near Washington D.C. after a suicide attempt, and at the time, his reaction was relief &ndash; that he wouldn&rsquo;t have to try to kill himself again since AIDS was going to take care of it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The doctor who diagnosed him told Mick he had only a few years to live. And even as Mick kept outliving that death sentence, he believed his time was short, and he lived according to that assumption. He&rsquo;d work for a few years, and then he&rsquo;d
        cash out &ndash; take whatever money he&rsquo;d saved, whatever retirement fund he&rsquo;d invested in, and spend it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Once, he took the money and traveled around Europe for a month. He used a 401K account to pay for his move from the East Coast to San Francisco in 1991. He used another account to binge on methamphetamine, his drug of choice since college in San Diego.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Mick bounced between addiction and sobriety. Untreated mental health problems &ndash; depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit disorder, anxiety &ndash; made it near-impossible to stay clean and safe.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The addiction and depression complicated his AIDS. In the thick of meth addiction, he&rsquo;d forget to take his medication. Depression left him profoundly unmotivated to care for himself</span>
    <span>.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He calls the time around his 50th birthday his &ldquo;dark period.&rdquo; It lasted for years.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He was in low-income housing in the Tenderloin, he had no money, no job and few prospects for finding work. He was alone and secluded, and he felt too old for a gay community that so prominently valued youth and vitality.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;By that time, they were saying this is a chronic illness and people with HIV are living as long a life as people who are negative,&rdquo; Mick said. &ldquo;And I thought, &lsquo;Oh my God, what am I going to do?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In those years, Mick lived &ldquo;like a zombie.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d stay in his home for days at a time, not bathing, not changing clothes, watching TV and barely eating. He started using meth again. He ignored friends and avoided calls from his mother.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In his tiny apartment, he was alone and untouchable. He&rsquo;d sit in his bed, &ldquo;wasting away and feeling like I&rsquo;m unworthy.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Then one day, four years ago, he was clipping a toenail and he nicked a lesion that was growing there, unnoticed by him. Blood spurted </span>
    <span>all over.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;He dragged himself to a doctor. The lesion was Kaposi sarcoma, something that HIV-positive people weren&rsquo;t supposed to get anymore. His doctors were stunned.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Mick was shocked too. The lesion, a classic sign of AIDS, was a red flag that reminded him he was still alive, and he was going to have to take care of himself. He had to start thinking and acting like a survivor.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I decided either it was time to commit suicide,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or do something to keep living.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Mick went back on the HIV drugs and got sober again. He joined the 50-plus group with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and started rebuilding a social life he&rsquo;d abandoned in the depths of addiction and depression. He went back to school. He
        decided to invest in his life, not his death.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>After Ganymede stopped taking his HIV drugs, his doctor asked if he was suicidal. Ganymede said he just didn&rsquo;t want to hurt anymore.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>It took him years to spin out of his grief, to decide if he could be someone other than a man consumed by sorrow. By the time he decided to live again, his health was failing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Going off his AIDS medications had crashed his immune system, and restoring it was a long, painful ordeal. He spent months in 2009 getting daily drug infusions and was in and out of the hospital all year.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>As he recovered, he resumed relationships with old friends who also had survived the epidemic, and he reclaimed the house he&rsquo;d shared with two dead lovers. He was determined, though, to resist another love. He didn&rsquo;t think he could bear
        anymore loss.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But in 2010, he went to a </span>
    <span>sex</span>
    <span>&nbsp;party in San Francisco and he met a man.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;By the end of the evening, I knew this was my next chapter,&rdquo; Ganymede said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>A month after they met, Cullen Frandsen moved into Ganymede&rsquo;s home. Two years later, Cullen&rsquo;s former partner, Warren Page, moved in with them. Ganymede and Cullen married in 2013, in a ceremony in their living room.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;First I moved in my boyfriend. Then I moved in his boyfriend,&rdquo; Ganymede said with a laugh, sitting in the sun with Cullen and Warren, the three of them smoking cigarettes and marijuana and sipping iced tea.</span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;</span>
    <span>&ldquo;Which does not even begin to describe the relationship. Now it&rsquo;s family. We all love each other.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Cullen, 58, and Warren, 68, are HIV-positive too, though Cullen was diagnosed in 2005 and has never lost a lover or close friend to AIDS.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede worries about the future in a way that Cullen does not.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I live in fear that this time I will be the one who leaves behind a partner,&rdquo; he said, </span>
    <span>beginning to cry</span>
    <span>.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>...</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede recognizes how fortunate he is. He owns a home. He has a new family &ndash; vibrant Cullen to argue and laugh with, Warren to bake chocolate chip cookies on a too-hot summer day.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Some days, he can hardly believe that he got one more chance to fall in love.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so blessed. I had so much passion and joy and happiness, and the price has been terrible sorrow and loss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly willing to pay that price.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede wears his long gray hair pulled back into a loose ponytail, and a ring through his nose. He exudes a quiet but insistent energy, an undeniable authority. He&rsquo;s the orbital center of his family in the hills. A few of his friends call
        him &ldquo;St. Ganymede,&rdquo; Cullen says with a fond eyeroll. Ganymede teases that Cullen is &ldquo;the minister&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>It&rsquo;s clear, though, that Ganymede is more fragile than his partners. Neuropathy makes it difficult to walk, scars from a skin infection brought on by immunotherapy drugs cover his shins.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>His body is stiff, painful, and he&rsquo;s easily fatigued. When Ganymede struggles to get up from a chair, the others pretend not to notice. Cullen and Warren do almost all of the cooking and cleaning, and Ganymede can&rsquo;t help but feel useless
        in his own home.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>His libido has faded too, and he misses some of the activities that were once so key to his spirituality, though he still has sex and has found comfort in a gentler sort of physical intimacy.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 59, but I feel closer to 70,&rdquo; Ganymede said. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ganymede tries to be patient with himself and his infirmity. Every morning, when he wakes to the aches in his legs, he tells himself to be grateful. He chooses to be happy.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;I get to go through the awful process of aging with this disease that literally 100 of my friends never got to do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As bad as it is, they never got the chance to do even this.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>

<p class="c1">
    <span>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for long-term survivors to feel older than their years. They often complain of frailty and mobility problems that typically afflict people older than those in their 50s and 60s. They have higher-than-expected rates of heart
        disease, diabetes and a host of other age-related disorders.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>D</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" name="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup>
    <span>octors and scientists are beginning to understand that long-time exposure to HIV, even in those who seemed to remain otherwise healthy, may cause premature aging. Even the drugs themselves can harm the liver and kidneys, causing further aging problems.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In June, doctors at UCSF and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center released results from a study of 155 people &ndash; mostly men in their mid-50s &ndash; who were HIV-positive. Nearly half of them were suffering cognitive impairment.
        More than a third had some vision loss and 14 percent were hearing impaired. One in four had suffered a fall in the previous year &ndash; a sign of frailty.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Those rates are more typical of what doctors would expect to see in men a decade or older than the ones who were studied.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Why these men are experiencing early effects of aging isn&rsquo;t entirely understood, </span>
    <span>said the study&rsquo;s lead author, Dr. Meredith Greene, a UCSF geriatrician who also specializes in HIV and AIDS care</span>
    <span>. But what is clear, she said, is that the type of care that long-term survivors of AIDS need is shifting.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about HIV anymore,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re dealing with multiple, chronic medical conditions.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>

    <span>David Spiher spent much of his life convinced AIDS would kill him. There were times he believed he wouldn&rsquo;t outlive his dog. That he&rsquo;d never own a home or retire or grow old with someone he loves.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>David met Ralph Thurlow 11 years ago, at a 12-step meeting for recovering alcoholics in Manhattan. Ralph was newly diagnosed with HIV and panicking. He went to the meeting, feeling scared and alone, and he stood up and said out loud that he was positive.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>After the meeting, David introduced himself. And he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be OK. You&rsquo;re going to live.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>What David said that day was true enough &ndash; by then people with AIDS were starting to live. David himself had been living with AIDS for nearly 20 years.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>They started dating about six months after they met, and they moved to the Bay Area in 2006, when Ralph got a job as a veterinary surgeon caring for animals in a research lab. They bought a small house in Hayward with a large yard of tangled gardens
        and dozens of animals &ndash; chickens and turkeys, rats and guinea pigs, dogs and cats. David found work as a development administrator at an Oakland private school.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>They were alive and they were healthy. They made new friends, they started a new life.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>One night in early 2013 they were playing cribbage, just the two of them. In cribbage, players draw cards and add up points based on the face of their cards, and Ralph pulled a five and an eight. And he got stuck.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>David remembers asking him, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s five and eight?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He was met with a long silence.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;Do you know what five and eight make?&rdquo; David asked, gently.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ralph said, &ldquo;Give me a minute.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;It took an inordinate time of my life, him not answering,&rdquo; David said, recalling that night.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ralph had lost his job a few months earlier. He later admitted that he&rsquo;d been struggling at work, needing a calculator to add grams as he measured drugs for his animals. He&rsquo;d thought it was just age, and if it was something more serious,
        it wasn&rsquo;t anything he wanted to think too hard about.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>They saw the first doctor in February 2013, kicking off months of testing and visits with specialists. It wasn&rsquo;t until they happened upon a doctor who&rsquo;d worked at the National Institutes of Health that they finally got an answer.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>R</span><sup><a href="#cmnt13" name="cmnt_ref13">[m]</a></sup>
    <span>alph has HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorder. HAND can occur when HIV breaches the nervous system. Most people suffer relatively mild cognitive symptoms that impair memory, language and decision-making skills, but they may still go about their
        daily lives. Ralph has a more severe form of it that causes dementia.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He will lose the ability to walk, to speak, to bathe and feed himself.</span>
    <span>&nbsp;The condition is fatal.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;His prognosis is five to seven years out,&rdquo; David said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really hard prognosis.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Some days no one but David can tell there is anything off about Ralph. Other days, Ralph clearly struggles for words, clutches at memories that have started to slip away or vanished altogether.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ralph can still drive and shop, clean the house and take care of their animals. But in June, he lost his car keys somewhere in the house and they still haven&rsquo;t found them. That month, David realized that Ralph had stopped cooking lunch for himself
        because he was afraid of starting a fire.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>David has taken ownership of Ralph&rsquo;s medical care and worked months to get him on disability. To deal with his stress, David paints. He&rsquo;s produced a collection of portraits and scenes from their life, splashy, colorful oils that are both
        painful and beautiful.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>They&rsquo;re an odd couple, something they both acknowledge and enjoy. David, 57, often seems laid-back </span>
    <span>&ndash;</span>
    <span>&nbsp;he wears well the rumpled look of an artist </span>
    <span>&ndash;</span>
    <span>&nbsp;but he has the spit and fire of a New Yorker in him. </span>
    <span>Ralph, 56, is small and compact, his sharp eyes serious behind his glasses. He&rsquo;s quiet until he&rsquo;s not, and then he&rsquo;ll tell his life story, slipping in wry details without cracking a smile.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ralph would gladly take an experimental medicine &ndash; anything that might help him and add to research around his dementia.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;If there was a clinical trial I&rsquo;d go on it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go on all of them.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>There are no drugs that will save Ralph &ndash; not yet. After the global AIDS community fought so hard to find antiretrovirals and other drugs to fight HIV, it feels, to David, that the survivors have been left adrift.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9">
    <span>But David has seen miracles. His own life, that he&rsquo;s here at all, is amazing. Ralph has five years, the doctors say. A lot can happen in five years.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9">
    <span>&ldquo;So on some level I don&rsquo;t lose heart,&rdquo; David said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide for myself that it&rsquo;s over and </span>
    <span>done.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In the deadliest years of the epidemic, Peter Greene used to offer his apartment in the Castro to families caring for their brothers and sons. They&rsquo;d stay in a spare room, for as long as they needed, and he&rsquo;d give them some small peace
        of mind while they worried and grieved.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>His home was a safe place for these families, and for three decades it was his personal sanctuary, too. Until he lost it in 2013.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter lives in Palm Springs now, in a mobile home that his friends helped him buy for $60,000. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;lovely&rdquo; home, he says, tucked against the base of a mountain. A community of older gay men has been coalescing in Palm Springs
        over the past decade, many of them survivors like Peter, looking for somewhere affordable, somewhere nice to settle down.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter&rsquo;s lucky to have a home there. He knows this. But it is not San Francisco. &ldquo;I was banished from the kingdom I knew,&rdquo; Peter said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The travel agency remains open, for now. A long-time client who owns several properties in the Castro offered Peter a low-rent storefront on 19th Street. Peter oversees the business from his new home 500 miles away.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Peter is determined to come back to San Francisco. But while he&rsquo;s living on a fixed income from </span>
    <span>Social Security disability</span>
    <span>, he can&rsquo;t imagine how he&rsquo;ll manage that. The only money he earns from Now, Voyager goes toward covering the costs of running the agency. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>H</span><sup><a href="#cmnt14" name="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a></sup>
    <span>ousing is hardly a problem unique to AIDS survivors. </span>
    <span>But the fallout from losing an affordable apartment can be especially grim for them. When he left San Francisco, Peter had to give up doctors who were intimately familiar with his long medical history. He lost support services that don&rsquo;t exist
        outside San Francisco.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He was removed from his closest, oldest friends &ndash; the remains of his social network</span>
    <span>.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>For a week in October Peter was back in San Francisco, staying with friends who have spare bedrooms or couches. He scheduled three different medical procedures, so he could see the doctors he trusts. Two nights he went to Martuni&rsquo;s, the Market
        Street karaoke bar, where he sang with pianists he&rsquo;s known for more than a decade.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He&rsquo;s already outlived almost all of his friends, and the irony is that he&rsquo;s now outliving even those who never had HIV &ndash; who are dying of cancer or heart disease or other ailments of old age.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But he reaches for joy and gratitude. He admits that living more than half his life with a fatal illness has forced him to live as most people probably don&rsquo;t. To grasp the moment. To embrace what is precious.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;For me, the HIV story is full of woe, but I don&rsquo;t want that to be the message,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;There was suffering. But you can see, I&rsquo;m having a nice day. And this is the moment, and we&rsquo;re all walking, talking,
        eating. We can go traveling again. Hopefully there&rsquo;s more of that.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>This</span>
    <span>&nbsp;year&rsquo;s Pride Week was warm and cloudless in the Castro.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The days leading up to the parade are always celebratory, music spilling from bars into the sunlight, restaurants packed, young men walking with their arms slung around each other or sharing long, indiscreet kisses. There&rsquo;s a carefree energy
        to the neighborhood during Pride, something transparent and innocent, like the Castro before AIDS. This June the excitement was more palpable than usual, amped up by the Supreme Court&rsquo;s same-sex marriage ruling. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The survivors were there too, walking among the young crowds. They didn&rsquo;t draw attention, though their cheeks are gaunt, their gaits stiff with chronic pain. </span>
    <span>Some bear no scars, but their eyes are hollowed and distant.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Harry Breaux was one of them. He stood at the corner of Market and Castro streets, where he volunteers as a neighborhood ambassador, handing out maps and brochures to tourists. He told them which building once held Harvey Milk&rsquo;s camera shop,
        suggested they stop by the GLBT History Museum. He gave them directions to the Haight and the Mission.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Harry doesn&rsquo;t live in the Castro. He can&rsquo;t afford it. Still, his pride &ndash; in the Castro, and the history and generation it still represents to him &ndash; is earnest and intense. But it&rsquo;s not home, not anymore.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m</span>
    <span class="c0">&nbsp;living this life, but I&rsquo;m not of it,&rdquo; Harry said. He glanced around at the young men to whom the Castro now belongs. &ldquo;The people that have shared my life with me are dead.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In a year or two</span>
    <span>, </span>
    <span>nearly two-thirds of people with AIDS or HIV in San Francisco will be age 50 or older. That percentage is going to keep climbing as rates of new infections drop and the population of people with AIDS stays healthy and grows older.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The San Francisco Model &ndash; once, and still, heralded as the highest standard of AIDS care &ndash; has been transformed since the darkest days. Providing services for the sick and dying is no longer a priority, simply because there aren&rsquo;t
        enough cases. Instead, the focus has shifted to prevention.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>L</span><sup><a href="#cmnt15" name="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup>
    <span>ast year, San Francisco announced a campaign to cut new HIV infections and deaths by 90 percent by the year 2020. The end of the epidemic is in sight, public health leaders believe.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>T</span><sup><a href="#cmnt16" name="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a></sup>
    <span>hat&rsquo;s thrilling, and any work to prevent HIV and AIDS is important, said Tez Anderson, one of the earliest and most outspoken advocates for long-term survivors. He created Let&rsquo;s Kick ASS (AIDS Survivor Syndrome), what may be the world&rsquo;s
        first long-term survivor group, two years ago.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>But for the very survivors around whom the San Francisco Model was built, the shift of focus can feel like abandonment. It&rsquo;s older men, not young people, who make up the bulk of those living with HIV and AIDS, Tez said. And it&rsquo;s clear
        that their needs are not a priority.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;All these programs that are focusing on the youth &ndash; we need to have parity,&rdquo; he said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c8">
    <span></span>

<p class="c1">
    <span>...</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Kevin VandenBergh walked into the Episcopal Church of St. John the Evangelical before the music started. It was a warm Thursday night, and the first guests were arriving for a casual dance for long-term survivors of AIDS.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Kevin had decided to go on a whim. He&rsquo;d been venturing out of his apartment a little more often in recent weeks, attending a couple of social meetings for long-term survivors. Depression was still a constant distraction, suicide still an option.
        But he was trying.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In the church he was nervous, hands shaking, talking a bit too fast. Before the dance was a buffet dinner, and before Kevin could change his mind and run home, a man he&rsquo;d met once or twice before took him by the arm and steered him to a table
        to eat. Within minutes, he&rsquo;d convinced Kevin to march with a contingent of long-term survivors in the Pride Parade a few days later. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>By the time the dance started, Kevin was feeling over-stimulated, but successful in his outing. He&rsquo;d said yes &ndash; he&rsquo;d ventured outside his quiet, lonely life. He danced for hours before heading home, but he wasn&rsquo;t even halfway
        down the block before a familiar song came on and lured him back.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>It was &ldquo;I Will Survive&rdquo; and Kevin recognized, later, how embarrassingly on-the-nose the song was for him. But it&rsquo;s still a great tune, he said. He used to dance to it at the Chicago clubs in the late &rsquo;70s.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>So he returned to church, and when the lights came up, Kevin was there, sweat-drenched and beaming, one of only a handful of men still dancing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Three days later he marched in the Pride Parade, carrying a banner that said &ldquo;Love Heals.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Holding the</span>
    <span>&nbsp;opposite end of the banner was John, a man Kevin had met at the dance. They&rsquo;d clicked; Kevin made John laugh. They marched down Market Street together, Kevin cheering himself hoarse, waving at the crowds and pumping his fist in the air.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The parade dumped them in Civic Center Plaza, where Kevin and John </span>
    <span>were swallowed by the crowds. Kevin reached for John, so they wouldn&rsquo;t lose each other.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;And all of a sudden I realized, we were holding hands,&rdquo; Kevin said. It&rsquo;s weeks later and his eyes are bright. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the last time I held someone&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">

<p class="c1">
    <span>David Spiher proposed to Ralph Thurlow in late 2013. Ralph responded with a quick and sincere no. He knew too many people with terrible marriages, he said. But the following February, Ralph proposed &ndash; on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, no less.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>He&rsquo;d forgotten to buy a gift, David says with a grin.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Ralph says he doesn&rsquo;t remember that.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>The wedding was July 25. The ceremony was simple, on a sunny afternoon at a zen center in Berkeley where they both practice. They married in front of 50 friends and family &ndash; a contingent from New York, Ralph&rsquo;s sister and niece, David&rsquo;s
        coworkers. The grooms wore white shirts and pants, and prayer beads around their necks.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>David gently guided Ralph through parts of the ceremony, whispering reminders to bow or turn, to grasp hands during the vows. Ralph might have just been nervous. His memory might have been fine.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In the corner was a three-tiered cake, shaped like the mountains around Yosemite Valley, a place they both love. Over one side spilled a frosted blue waterfall, and perched close to the edge was a cake topper made just for them. A friend designed
        a 3D-printed sculpture of David and Ralph sitting side-by-side in a rowboat, huddled close together, their hands grasping each other&rsquo;s knees. The boat was suspended over the edge of the waterfall, against the current &ndash; their backs
        to the turbulent, unknown future.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>These are not young men, said the zen master who married them, as he began the service. The crowd chuckled, and the grooms smiled too.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Turning serious, the zen master said, &ldquo;These are two men who have lived a life, who understand the sadness and the suffering that&rsquo;s connected with the deep well of love and passion.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;Probably the most important thing in a marriage is to be big enough to hold everything. If we can hold it then we&rsquo;re not afraid of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Please, in your marriage, hold your whole experience. All of it.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Acknowledge and reflect on the largeness of life, the zen master said. Then live it, day to day, breath to breath.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; the zen master said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;We can,&rdquo; David said, his eyes on Ralph. Ralph paused, then said it, too: &ldquo;We can.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;You can?&rdquo; said the zen master.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>David laughed. &ldquo;We do.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; Ralph said, only a breath behind.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>In a life defined by a plague and measured in loss and pain, in fear and loneliness, sometimes it&rsquo;s the smallest steps forward, the briefest moments of gratitude, that matter most. Waking up to the sunlight. Taking someone&rsquo;s hand.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
    <span>Saying yes.</span>
</p>
