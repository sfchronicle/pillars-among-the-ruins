<p class="lede"><span class="lede"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Greene is used to being alone with his memories.
There&#39;s hardly anyone left who shares his past, who knows what
he&rsquo;s talking about when he says, &quot;Remember
when?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So when he runs into an old friend volunteering at a
Christmas Eve banquet, he can&rsquo;t wait to dust off the stories he so
rarely gets to</span> <span>tell</span> <span>&mdash; the ones that make
him laugh long before the punchline, even the embarrassing ones that make
him shake his head, cheeks turning pink.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>They escape the din of the party for a quiet balcony
that overlooks City Hall, bundling up against an</span>
<span>afternoon</span> <span>chill that only a pair of San Franciscans
would consider cold.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Remember the weekend at the Russian River with
Peter&rsquo;s business partner?</span> <span>Remember that wild night at
the</span><span>&nbsp;bar,</span> <span>with the college friend who
introduced them?</span><span>&nbsp;Remember when Peter got caught with the
naked pictures of his old lover?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The blue sky fades to</span> <span>pearly</span>
<span>gray, and they&rsquo;re laughing hard enough to cry. What goes
unremarked, as the stories unspool, is that all of the men they&rsquo;re
talking about are dead.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Peter always expected he&rsquo;d be long dead by now,
too. He lived like that back then, his friend recalls. As if any day could
be his last.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;And then, the end never came,&rdquo; Peter says
with a chuckle, like it&rsquo;s just another old joke between
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>More than 30 years ago, when he learned he was infected
with the virus that causes AIDS, Peter was certain his life was over. Since
then, he&rsquo;s lost not just his lover and most of his friends, but his
livelihood, his community, his home.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>But here he is: 61, his beard flecked with gray though
his eyes are still a striking, youthful blue. A survivor, somehow spared by
a plague that killed tens of thousands just like him.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the luckiest unlucky person in the
world,&rdquo; he sometimes says. &ldquo;No one wants to be the last man
standing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">S</span>ince 1981, when the first man succumbed to a disease
that did not yet have a name, AIDS has taken</span><span>&nbsp;more
than</span> <span>20,000 lives in San Francisco, most of them gay men, most
of them decades too soon.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Students and lawyers, musicians and doctors, drugstore
clerks and teachers: they were young men exploring sex and drugs, falling
in love for the first time, building a political movement. They were still
growing up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>AIDS gutted their generation. But not everyone died.
Many men had the remarkable luck &ndash; and often brutal misfortune
&ndash; to struggle on. Now some have fought AIDS for half their lives, and
by the most primitive measure, they&rsquo;ve won. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In San Francisco and across the country,</span>
<span>AIDS has become an older person&rsquo;s disease: More than half of
those living with AIDS or HIV, the virus that causes it, are now 50 or
older. I</span><span>n San Francisco alone, 6,000 gay men have been living
with HIV or AIDS for at least 20 years.</span><span>&nbsp;Some have been
able to thrive. But most have not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>When they were diagnosed years ago, at the peak of the
epidemic, AIDS was almost always fatal; the prognosis was a few years,
maybe a few months</span><span class="c4">.</span><span>&nbsp;These men,
then in their 20s and 30s, weren&rsquo;t supposed to make it to 40. Now
some are 60, even 70 years old, still alive but wounded physically,
psychologically and economically.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For many, time stopped when they were diagnosed -- they
gave up on a future that they had no reason to believe would ever
arrive.</span> <span class="c5">So they have no savings, no retirement
money and no strategy for continuing to live in a city that&rsquo;s
increasingly unaffordable. Over the next decade or so,</span> <span class=
"c5">many</span> <span class="c5">will need financial aid when private
disability benefits run out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c5">They also are suffering debilitating health
problems, chronic illnesses brought on by a lifetime of living
with</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;AIDS and the toxic effects of its
treatment. Many live in stark isolation, feeling abandoned and
forgotten</span><span class="c8 c5">,</span> <span class="c5">even by the
gay community they helped build here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c5">San Francisco, which acted urgently to
battle AIDS as the epidemic took hold in the 1980s and 1990s, today is
ill-prepared to care for the disease&rsquo;s long-term survivors.</span>
<span>The city&rsquo;s health and social services infrastructure never
anticipated their needs, never made a plan to care for them. While doctors
and public health officials focus on eradicating AIDS once and for all,
precious few resources are aimed at helping those</span> <span>still
standing</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c5">Many survivors still have hope
&ndash;</span> <span>they&rsquo;re trying to turn toward the
future</span><span class="c5">. But they&rsquo;re scarcely able to</span>
<span class="c5">manage</span> <span class="c5">in a world that they gave
up on</span><span class="c5">, and now feel has given up on
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In the throes of a plague, no one thought about those
who would live.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Greene <span>was 22 when he hitchhiked to
San Francisco just after college. It was 1977 and he was Mr. Gay Colorado,
a title he won in a barroom stunt. With his Tom Selleck mustache and toned,
athletic body,</span><span>&nbsp;Peter was confident and fearless. He
supported himself with modeling gigs for gay newspapers and magazines,
posing half-naked in ads</span><span>&nbsp;for Castro bars.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He arrived in a city exploding with political and
cultural gay life,</span> <span>host to</span> <span>a great migration that
created a boomtown in the Castro.</span><span>&nbsp;It was a thrilling time
-- a new live-out-loud generation was coalescing around political
touchstones &ndash; the Stonewall Riots in New York City, attacks on gay
rights in California and the rest of the country, and in San Francisco, the
1978 assassinations of Supervisor Harvey Milk,</span> <span>the first
openly gay elected official in a major U.S. city</span><span>, and Mayor
George Moscone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For young gay men from places where living openly was
out of the question, the city, especially the Castro, offered a feast of
freedom and opportunity. They could walk down the street holding hands or
flirt in bars with windows facing the street. In the bathhouses they could
have sex with whomever, whenever, free of judgment or shame.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Still,</span> <span>&ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t just a Sodom
and Gomorrah as they like to paint San Francisco,&rdquo; Peter says.
&ldquo;We were all just young kids trying to figure out who we
were.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>AIDS was then an invisible</span><span>, not-yet-deadly
presence.</span> <span>It was never a disease of gay men alone; women and
straight men were always at risk too. But in San Francisco it was gay men
who were -- and still are -- most vulnerable to AIDS.</span> <span>And in
the earliest years</span> <span>HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus,
circulated among people who had no idea it existed, spreading silently
among men exploring unprecedented sexual freedom. But first slowly, then
relentlessly, HIV and AIDS began taking hold.</span></p>



<p class="c0"><span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_care').style.display='block'">Nine people died of AIDS in San Francisco in
1981.</span><span> By 1992, 30 people were dying each week.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Peter thinks he was infected within a few years,</span>
<span>maybe even a few months,</span><span>&nbsp;of his arrival in San
Francisco. By the time he tested positive in 1985, &ldquo;the party was
over.&rdquo;</span> <span>In those days, a decade before drugs were
developed that could arrest the disease, anyone who tested positive
expected to die quickly, gruesomely.</span> <span>Doctors did little to
discourage that thinking. Make the most of the little time you have
left,</span> <span>patients</span><span>&nbsp;were told.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;F</span><span>rom that day on,&rdquo; Peter
said, &ldquo;</span><span>you&rsquo;re always living with that in your
head.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Just a year earlier, Peter had started a travel
agency</span> <span>in the Castro</span> <span>with a friend, Jonathan
Klein. For a few years, theirs was a joyful, flourishing business catering
to the gay community. As the AIDS epidemic grew, they began charting final
trips for young clients who needed oxygen or wheelchairs to
travel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>His doctor died of AIDS just months after Peter tested
positive. Friends from high school and college died. In the Castro, where
he lived and worked,</span> <span>men his age stooped over canes, withering
away.</span> <span>Peter offered the spare bedroom in his apartment as a
refuge for families and friends keeping vigil over loved ones.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I saw one of the great world epidemics unfold in
front of my eyes,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;I have to carry that with me
the rest of my life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Peter&rsquo;s lover got sick, too. His 15-year romance
with Barry Sharp, a &ldquo;big, burly fisherman&rdquo; with a wife and two
daughters, was a &ldquo;Brokeback Mountain&rdquo; affair, he said. Most of
the year, Barry &nbsp;worked in the icy waters off the Aleutian Islands,
providing for his family. In the Castro, he lived a second life as a gay
man. Peter wasn&rsquo;t always happy with the arrangement,</span> <span>but
he</span> <span>was deeply in love from the moment they met.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Peter began battling his own disturbing symptoms --
rashes that wouldn&rsquo;t heal, colds that lingered too long, eye
infections that threatened his vision.</span> <span>He became obsessed with
keeping himself alive, signing up for every clinical trial he could,
blindly trying every experimental drug: AZT, an early drug that offered the
first real thread of hope but proved too weak; Compound Q, a Chinese
cucumber extract that caused some patients to lapse into comas.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Barry died in early 1994. He was, and remains,
Peter&rsquo;s only great love. By then he was divorced, and it was Peter
who cared for him to the end. He&rsquo;d lost close to 100 pounds from the
wasting caused by AIDS. &ldquo;It was horrible, just horrible, to watch the
person you care about go through that,&rdquo; Peter said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Though Peter kept fighting for his own life, he
remained convinced that AIDS would eventually kill him, too.
N</span><span>ot long after Barry&rsquo;s death, he cashed out of the
travel agency. H</span><span>e decided he might as well check out on his
terms. Instead of chaining himself to a business, he&rsquo;d travel and
enjoy the time he had left.</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d died when they told me,&rdquo; he
says now, &ldquo;I would have died a wealthy man with a successful
business.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Instead, more than 20 years later, the choices he made
then have had consequences he couldn&rsquo;t have anticipated on a future
he never expected to see. As old age approaches, he has no savings, little
income, and no way to afford the city he considers home.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">H</span>idden under the bed in his Market Street apartment is
the source of Kevin VandenBergh&rsquo;s greatest pride, and</span>
<span>deepest</span><span>&nbsp;regret.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Neatly stacked in a clear plastic bin is a collection
of Kevin&rsquo;s academic work. He rarely takes it out. But fanning folders
across his comforter one afternoon, leafing through faded typewritten
pages, he pulls out one paper, among the last he wrote, from the spring of
1986.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Reading it aloud, he can&rsquo;t help but marvel a bit
at his own words. He was a talented writer, no denying it. And then,
suddenly, he&rsquo;s angry.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;This is who you were,&rdquo; he says,</span>
<span>his voice</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>hard
and</span><span class=
"c4">&nbsp;</span><span>unforgiving.</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Where did you
go?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Thirty years ago, Kevin was a promising psychology
student at the University of Chicago. His instructors lavished him with
praise. In the margins of his papers they scrawled notes: the best student
they&rsquo;d seen in years, so gifted he was almost beyond critique. He
would excel in graduate school, they said, and was poised for a career in
academics or writing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It was heady stuff for a young man from a working-class
family; just getting an undergraduate degree had seemed a huge reach. But
he&rsquo;d begun to believe it was possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Then Kevin tested positive for HIV. At 26, he&rsquo;d
been handed</span> <span>a death sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The idea of graduate school vanished. &ldquo;I thought,
why bother?&rdquo; Kevin said. He took a job as an entry-level computer
programmer so he&rsquo;d have health insurance and a steady income while he
awaited the inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;In 1987, my life skittered off,&rdquo; Kevin
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a disaster ever since.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In a support group for people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS,
Kevin met men his age who were clearly dying --</span> <span>going blind or
suffering dementia from HIV invading their brains, or barely able to walk
anymore. It more terrifying than helpful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Every day he expected to begin failing himself. He took
experimental drugs, signing up for clinical trials and seeking out
underground &ldquo;buyers&rsquo; clubs&rdquo; for medications not yet legal
in the United States. Eventually, he began experiencing odd neurological
symptoms &ndash; shaky hands, a stiff, awkward walk. Tests showed he might
have an AIDS-related infection in his brain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He quit work immediately, and moved to San Francisco
soon after. That was in 1994. He&rsquo;s been on disability ever
since.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now 56, Kevin doesn&rsquo;t have a job and rarely
writes. He spends hours by himself in</span> <span>his apartment
overlooking the Castro</span><span>. Sometimes he&rsquo;s there all day,
alone with his regrets.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If he&rsquo;d</span><span>&nbsp;thought there was any
chance he would outlive AIDS, he might have stayed in school. He might have
saved for retirement or bought a home. Instead, he said, &ldquo;I was
preparing all that time to die.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now money, not his health, is Kevin&rsquo;s foremost
worry. During the five years he worked, he paid into a disability insurance
program that now provides enough to cover his rent, food and small
indulgences. But the policy will end when he turns 65, cutting his income
nearly in half. Living on Social Security alone, about $1,600 a month, will
mean he won&rsquo;t be able to afford rent.</span></p>

<p class="c0">
	<span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_disability').style.display='block'">It&rsquo;s a predicament common among long-term AIDS
	survivors in San Francisco.</span>
	<span>A</span> <span>2014</span>
	<span>city report estimated that up to 1,200 people with HIV or AIDS are
	dependent on private disability insurance that will expire at retirement
	age. Helping them stay in their homes or find new ones will require as much
	as $19 million in rental subsidies from city general funds over the next
	five years. But at the moment, the city has no plan to allocate that
	money.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span>Last spring, Kevin worked up the</span>
<span>courage</span> <span>to speak before a Board of Supervisors committee
about his money problems. But he&rsquo;s doubtful there will be help
coming. City leaders seem concerned, he says, but he and his peers would be
easy to overlook, to forget.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cohort that is just shuffling off
stage and will be gone at one point,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Then AIDS is
over and it&rsquo;s not a big deal.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He&rsquo;d like to work again, but his health is an
obstacle -- he fatigues easily, his anxiety is often so bad that full-time
employment seems impossible. In any case, he says, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going
to hire me?&rdquo; His computer skills are outdated and he has no recent
experience. Working also would mean giving up his disability income, a risk
he feels he can&rsquo;t take.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He feels trapped, he says. The path he&rsquo;s on now
was laid decades ago, when he gave up his ambitions and any chance at a
career in a field he loved.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;That was a life that I was supposed to at least
try to have,&rdquo; Kevin says, &ldquo;to achieve something I could be
proud of.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Among the papers in the box beneath his bed is a speech
Kevin gave at his high school graduation.</span> <span>Every man is
responsible for his own happiness, for choosing to seek joy, he
wrote.</span> <span>He&rsquo;d like to be that man, he says. But he
doesn&rsquo;t know how.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">S</span>itting on the patio of his home in the Oakland hills,
the afternoon just giving way to the evening&rsquo;s cool, Ganymede smokes
a cigarette and laughs, recalling some embarrassing incident from a road
trip made ages ago.</span> <span>And then he says a name and his smile
disappears.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He puts a fist to his mouth, closes his eyes. The tears
come suddenly, without warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>At 59, Ganymede has survived the deaths of two lovers,
countless friends, and his own battle with AIDS. Though both his partners
have been gone for many years now, his grief remains close to the surface.
A certain song, a particular photograph, sometimes just the mention of a
name can set him weeping.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Still, he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so
blessed.&rdquo; He has his home, a family, and a perspective not often
granted to someone only on the cusp of old age, one shaped by a life
that&rsquo;s been both tortured and full of love.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I had so much passion and joy and happiness, and
the price has been terrible sorrow and loss,&rdquo; he says.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly willing to pay that price.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Ganymede was born Jeffrey Andrews. In his early 20s,
while living in San Diego, he went to</span><span>&nbsp;a psychology
lecture that touched on the</span> <span>archetype of the hero in Greek
mythology who stood for love unbound by gender. He identified so strongly
with the character that he changed his name.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Not long after, in the summer of 1984, Ganymede sailed
from San Diego to San Francisco with his lover, Alain Auras. The two shared
a fascination with the union of sex and spirituality, and would build a
community of queer men and women with similar interests. Their community
became a kind of family, one that would be eviscerated by AIDS.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Over the next decade, Ganymede tended to more deaths
than he could count. He had always ministered to the spiritual needs of his
group, so he was called to dying friends&rsquo; bedsides, praying or
meditating with them through their last breaths.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He and Alain both tested positive for HIV in 1985, the
same year they bought the house in the Oakland hills. But while Ganymede
remained fairly healthy, Alain quickly declined. &ldquo;I spoon-fed him
water on the day he died,&rdquo; says Ganymede.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>That was at the peak of the epidemic, in 1992. Later,
as the deaths from the epidemic finally slowed and the wave of suffering
started to recede, Ganymede fell in love again. His new partner, Steven
Brown, was also HIV-positive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Ganymede convinced Steven to leave his Twin Peaks
apartment and move to Oakland, to try to heal together away from the
battlefield San Francisco had become. Steven filled their home with his
collections &mdash; art and vinyl records, books on sex and psychotherapy,
lush ferns that Ganymede still tends to today.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Ganymede embraced their isolation. He pulled away from
what remained of his community, from friends he&rsquo;d relied on while
Alain was dying. He and Steven leaned into each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;We were pillars standing amidst the
ruins,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>When drugs to treat HIV arrived in 1995, their vision
of a future together truly seemed possible. Antiretrovirals had a sudden
and dramatic impact on the epidemic.</span><span>&nbsp;Deaths from AIDS in
San Francisco dropped from nearly 1,500 in 1995 to just 424 in 1997. Three
years after the drugs came along, the Bay Area Reporter, a weekly gay
newspaper, ran a banner headline: &ldquo;No obits.&rdquo; For the first
time in 15 years, there were no deaths from AIDS to report.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>But AIDS could still grab hold. The drugs kept Ganymede
alive, but they couldn&rsquo;t save Steven. The virus in his body was too
deeply rooted, his immune system too broken.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Losing Alain had been terrible, but Steven&rsquo;s
death in 2006 broke Ganymede&rsquo;s heart in a way that felt beyond
repair. He&rsquo;d allowed himself to feel safe with Steven. He thought
they&rsquo;d survived.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In his grief, he drew further away from his friends.
He&rsquo;d quit his job as a software engineer to care for Steven, so had
lost that structure, too. Soon after, in quick succession, Ganymede&rsquo;s
cat died, and then his mother. He&rsquo;d never felt so alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to be here with so much
sorrow and loss, and not just Steven, but the whole legacy of sorrow and
loss,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I felt resentful that they all left, they got
to be free of their pain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He stopped taking the drugs that were holding his AIDS
at bay, and braced for whatever future might come.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">J</span>esus Guillen doesn&rsquo;t look like a man in
pain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He has an easy smile and carries himself like a dancer.
His hair is often dyed &ndash; bright pink one day, platinum blond another
&ndash; and his face is unlined and relaxed. The pain shows through,
though, in a tightness around his eyes and the way he rubs his leg, firmly
but absently, as if he&rsquo;s not aware he&rsquo;s doing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Nothing relieves the pain in his legs entirely. Some
days he can cope with it. One Saturday in January he celebrated his 56th
birthday &mdash; and 30th year of living with AIDS &mdash; with a party in
his home, and he played guitar and ate and sang until midnight. But some
days, most days, the pain drives him to tears. It can be exhausting,
sapping his energy and making even a meal with a friend seem impossible.
It&rsquo;s kept him out of work for 10 years.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>When he tested positive for HIV in 1986, Jesus was 26,
a naive young man from a small town in Mexico who&rsquo;d moved to Los
Angeles for a change of pace and to pursue a career in acting and singing.
He got tested after learning that someone he&rsquo;d slept with had died of
AIDS. He assumed he would soon die too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Yet he remained mostly healthy for many years. He began
antiretroviral therapy in 2000, on the advice of his doctor, but either the
drugs or the HIV left him with mild neuropathy &ndash; nerve damage that
caused a numb, tingling sensation in his leg.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Then in 2007 he found a lump in his neck. It was
lymphoma, a type of cancer that&rsquo;s been linked to long-term infection
with HIV. The chemotherapy treatment was harsh, likely made worse by his
weakened immune system.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He managed to knock back the cancer, though, and
avoided new AIDS complications. But the experience left him with anxiety
&mdash; a common problem among AIDS survivors and a symptom of
post-traumatic stress disorder. Since his cancer, he has had insomnia and a
recurring nightmare. &ldquo;Every night is the same dream,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to turn on the light and I
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The cancer treatment also worsened his neuropathy,
contorting it into</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>severe chronic
pain. Together, his ailments sometimes make Jesus feel far older than his
years.</span></p>

	<span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_aging').style.display='block'">Doctors and scientists are beginning to understand that
	long-time exposure to HIV, even in those who seem to remain otherwise

	disorders.</span>
	<span>&nbsp;More than a third of all people infected with

<p class="c0"><span>Complaints of frailty and mobility difficulties,
typically afflicting people older than those in their 50s and 60s, are
common among AIDS survivors in that age group. They also have
higher-than-expected rates of heart disease, diabetes and a host of other
age-related disorders.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>A UCSF study of older, HIV-positive men released last
year found that nearly half were suffering cognitive impairment. More than
a third had some vision loss, and 14 percent were hearing impaired. One in
four had suffered a fall in the previous year &ndash; a sign of
frailty.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Why HIV/AIDS survivors are experiencing early effects
of aging isn&rsquo;t entirely understood, according to the study&rsquo;s
lead author, Dr. Meredith Greene, a UCSF geriatrician. What&rsquo;s clear
is that the type of care that long-term survivors need is significantly
shifting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about HIV anymore,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re dealing with multiple, chronic medical
conditions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Jesus was able to strike one item off his list of
AIDS-related afflictions: hepatitis C. He&rsquo;d been infected for many
years but with a new, exhaustive drug therapy he was able to cure it last
year.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Two months into that treatment, he was sitting in his
sunny Hayes Valley apartment, thinking how nice it would be to have one
less chronic disease to worry over. His home, a warren of brightly painted
rooms filled with his photos and artwork, is his sanctuary. On days when
the pain is too intense or he wakes crying from nightmares, he meditates in
his bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>With just his cat, Mija, for company, Jesus says he
doesn&rsquo;t get lonely, but worries about being alone. The hepatitis C
treatment was exhausting at times, but bearable.</span><span class=
"c8">&nbsp;</span><span>What will happen if his cancer returns, if AIDS
rears up again or if his pain becomes disabling? Whom will he turn to if he
needs help?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He knows he should have a living will and someone
appointed to make tough decisions about his care. His mother in Mexico is
too far away, and it seems like too much responsibility to put on even a
good friend.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I keep thinking a partner should do that,&rdquo;
Jesus said. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t have a partner now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He does have close friends, people he calls family.
He&rsquo;s active: singing at neighborhood talent shows and fundraisers,
visiting local fairs and festivals to dance or take photos. In recent years
he&rsquo;s taken up activism, in particular to support long-term survivors
of AIDS. He volunteers nearly every day with groups trying to draw
attention to their cause. Last summer, he started a Facebook group for
long-term survivors that now has more than 1,300 members.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>But he longs to feel more useful &mdash; for a life
beyond AIDS. He wants to work and to share his art and his music with a
wider audience. He wants to fall in love. He wants to be seen and
embraced.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I&rsquo;ve had so much on this
earth: family, friends, creative things, studying. But that&rsquo;s
something I&rsquo;m missing. I always wanted to be married and have a
family,&rdquo; Jesus said. &ldquo;If that happens, it&rsquo;s beautiful,
and it&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">I</span>solation is yet another bitter side effect of
survival.</span></p>

<p class="c0">
	<span>Just how many survivors live largely in seclusion is
	difficult to determine.</span>
	<span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_isolation').style.display='block'">These men often aren&rsquo;t tapped
	into social groups or services for people with HIV.</span>
	<span>They&rsquo;re hard to reach, hard to count.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span>They don&rsquo;t have jobs that offer structure. Their
parents may be dead, and other family ties severed long ago. They
don&rsquo;t have children. Their only connections to the larger world may
be tenuous and brief &ndash; phone calls with fellow survivors, an
appointment with a therapist or doctor, small talk with a cashier at the
corner store.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Isolation creates both psychological and practical
complications. It</span><span>&nbsp;brings increased risk of depression,
anxiety and other mental health problems. Those without partners often have
less income, making them more vulnerable to financial upsets like losing an
apartment or coping with cost-of-living increases. Those who lost loved
ones during the epidemic may still feel too brittle, too emotionally
damaged, to form new relationships or friendships. Even the smallest risk
of losing someone again can feel too dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>From his apartment window, Kevin VandenBergh has a view
over the dips and swells of San Francisco to downtown and across the bay to
the Oakland hills. On a clear day, Mount Diablo juts into the horizon. But
Kevin hardly seems aware of it. He rarely ventures outside.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For years, his social life has been thin. He has a
roommate, but they don&rsquo;t get along. There&rsquo;s a weekly lunch with
an ex-boyfriend, the staff he sees at the animal shelter where he sometimes
volunteers, occasional meetings with an informal support group for
long-term survivors. But just working up the will to go out each time is a
struggle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In his living room, the only obvious signs of his
presence are a stack of DVDs of favorite TV shows and mementos of his
beloved cat, Truman, who died two years ago. A framed photo of Truman sits
on a shelf, the cat&rsquo;s tall, carpeted play structure stands in one
corner.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Out of work for 20 years and alone for much of that
time, Kevin is awkward and tense in social situations. He often overshares,
only to become self-conscious and withdraw. He fidgets, his hands in
constant motion &ndash; rubbing his thighs, knotting his fingers, tugging
at his clothes. When he meets new people, he dreads the moment when they
ask what he does for a living.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I feel like my life has been a total
waste,&rdquo; Kevin says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve accomplished nothing. I have
nothing to offer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He&rsquo;s battled depression for most of his adult
life. It&rsquo;s clouded his actions and distorted his perspective.
It&rsquo;s made living with AIDS even more of a burden. He gets free
therapy through a psychiatry clinic at California Pacific Medical Center,
but it isn&rsquo;t really helping, he says.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Years ago, after he tested positive for HIV, Kevin
constantly feared rejection from other men. He would feel indebted to
potential partners who accepted him, even if there wasn&rsquo;t a spark of
romance. These days, dating men his age can feel like a minefield, so
he&rsquo;s largely avoided it. Everyone&rsquo;s damaged. Everyone carries
baggage.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_pets').style.display='block'">For 10 years, Truman was his closest companion.</span>
	<span>He talked to the cat constantly, confided his thoughts and feelings.
	When he was so depressed he stayed in bed day after day, Truman was there,
	curled up at his side.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;He was the love of my life, the most intimate
relationship I have ever had,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He was my reason for
living.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Truman&rsquo;s death would hit Kevin harder than that
of any friend he&rsquo;d lost during the epidemic. When Truman died, Kevin
started thinking seriously about suicide. He made a plan.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Peter Greene opened his Castro travel agency with
Jonathan Klein in 1984, it was among the first catering to gay men who were
just starting to travel openly in couples and in groups. The business
partners came up with the idea while on a gay bike tour of China that Peter
had organized. They named the agency Now, Voyager, after a classic Bette
Davis film.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>They&rsquo;d co-owned the agency on 18th Street for
almost a decade when Peter decided to cash out and sell his share to
Jonathan. But he was still involved -- his apartment was right above the
office</span><span class="c4">,</span><span>&nbsp;and he&rsquo;d sometimes
pitch in when Jonathan was away.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The two men remained close friends, though there was
never a romantic spark between them. They&rsquo;d always shared a love of
travel and adventure. They&rsquo;d both been popular figures in the Castro,
circling many of the same social scenes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>One early spring night in 2013, they went with a group
of friends went to the Castro Theater to see the comedian Coco Peru. After
the show, not ready to let the evening end, they walked to Peter&rsquo;s
apartment. Jonathan, though, played host, setting out cheese and crackers,
decanting wine, keeping everyone&rsquo;s glasses filled.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span>Jonathan, his friends knew, had been under increasing
stress in recent months.</span><span class=
"c4">&nbsp;</span><span>He&rsquo;d lost</span><span class=
"c4">&nbsp;</span><span>his apartment when the building was sold and been
forced to move out of the city. The building housing Now, Voyager and
Peter&rsquo;s apartment also was up for sale, and Jonathan worried both
that his business might fold and his friend might also lose his
home.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So on this night, his friends were heartened to see him
gracious and witty, his old charming self. No one knew he was saying
goodbye.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d already written his suicide
note,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;He already knew what he was going to
do.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Two days later, on a cold April morning, Jonathan drove
to the Golden Gate Bridge. He parked, walked out on the span and jumped to
his death. He was 61.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Jonathan had tested positive for HIV in 1985, the same
time as Peter.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>It wasn&rsquo;t
AIDS that killed Jonathan, and it wasn&rsquo;t AIDS, at least not entirely,
that drove him to suicide. Before depression and a host of anxieties,
he&rsquo;d been one of the survivors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Not long after Jonathan&rsquo;s death, the 18th Street
building was sold. Peter was forced out of</span><span class=
"c8">&nbsp;</span><span>his apartment. The travel agency, which Jonathan
had willed him, was displaced too. Suddenly Peter, like his friend before
him, was being pushed out of San Francisco, his home for more than 30
years.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Peter doesn&rsquo;t entertain thoughts of suicide. But
he is scared, worried about being cut off from everyone and everything
familiar. He doesn&rsquo;t see easy answers to the knot of problems before
him.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;It was the perfect storm for him,&rdquo; he said
of Jonathan. &ldquo;Sometimes it feels that way for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">S</span>uicide has been an escape from AIDS since the epidemic
began. In the horrifying, hopeless early years, men would hoard drugs to
end things themselves before AIDS could kill them. Some would throw
themselves farewell parties.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>But even after antiretrovirals came along and AIDS no
longer meant certain death, the suicides didn&rsquo;t stop. Between 2009
and 2012, 4 percent of people with HIV or AIDS who died in San Francisco
killed themselves, a rate far above the overall national average of about
1.5 percent of all deaths.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Though AIDS drugs now are widely available and much
easier to tolerate, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for survivors to stop taking
their medication &ndash; for days, weeks or months &ndash; in what may be
less an overt death wish than a retreat from a life so fractured.</span>
<span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>For long-term AIDS survivors, nearly
half of whom may suffer bouts of depression,</span> <span>suicidal feelings
can be</span> <span>triggered by loneliness and isolation, or by grief that
can seem never-ending.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>When Ganymede stopped taking his HIV drugs, his doctor
asked him if he was suicidal. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to hurt
anymore,&rdquo; he answered.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It would take him years to spin out of his grief over
Steven&rsquo;s death, to decide if he could be someone other than a man
consumed by sorrow. &ldquo;In the face of such adversity and wanting to
give up, you have to choose &mdash; you have to make a choice to be happy,
to be grateful,&rdquo; Ganymede says. &ldquo;That was a very difficult
journey for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>By the time he decided to live again, though, his
health was failing. His immune system had crashed; restoring it was a long,
painful ordeal. For months in 2009, he received daily infusions of drugs,
and was in and out of the hospital all year.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As he recovered, he resumed relationships with old
friends who&rsquo;d also survived the epidemic. He reclaimed the lonely
home he&rsquo;d shared with the two lovers he mourned. He kept mementos of
them in every room, but started thinking toward the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He was determined, though, to resist falling in love
again. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine bearing any more loss. But in 2010, at a
sex party in San Francisco, he met someone. &ldquo;By the end of the
evening, I knew this was my next chapter,&rdquo; Ganymede said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>A month after they met, Cullen Frandsen moved into
Ganymede&rsquo;s home. Two years later, Cullen&rsquo;s former partner,
Warren Page, moved in with them. Ganymede and Cullen married in 2013, in a
ceremony in their living room.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;First I moved in my boyfriend. Then I moved in
his boyfriend,&rdquo; Ganymede says with a laugh, sitting in the sun with
Cullen and Warren, smoking pot and sipping iced tea on their patio.
&ldquo;Which does not even begin to describe the relationship. Now
it&rsquo;s family. We all love each other.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Both Cullen, 58, and Warren, 68, are also HIV-positive.
For Cullen, though, it&rsquo;s been a far different journey. He tested
positive in 2005 and went on antiretrovirals within months. He hasn&rsquo;t
experienced AIDS as a death threat, has never lost a lover or close friend
to AIDS.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And so, even as he embraces the future again, Ganymede
worries about it in a way that Cullen does not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I live in fear that this time, I will be the one
who leaves behind a partner.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">I</span>n early 2013, David Spiher and Ralph Thurlow were
spending a quiet night at their Hayward home after the chaos of the
holidays. Sitting at the kitchen table, their cats weaving between their
legs, they played cribbage, a favorite card game.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Ralph pulled a five and an eight from the stack of
cards. To make his next move, he needed to add them up. He
couldn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s five and eight?&rdquo; David
prompted. Ralph stared at his cards.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Do you know what five and eight make?&rdquo;
David asked again, gently.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Give me a minute,&rdquo; Ralph said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;It took an inordinate time of my life, him not
answering,&rdquo; David says, recalling the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For two men who had survived</span> <span>the
scourge</span><span>&nbsp;of AIDS in relatively good health, that evening
transformed what had been mainly a simple, happy life. The disease, they
would soon learn, had reached Ralph&rsquo;s brain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>David, who has been HIV-positive since 1986, spent much
of his life convinced AIDS would kill him -- that he wouldn&rsquo;t outlive
his dog, nevermind own a home or retire or grow old with someone. But
medical science helped save him. He&rsquo;d like to believe it can save the
man he loves.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>They met 12 years ago at a 12-step meeting for
recovering alcoholics in Manhattan. Ralph, newly diagnosed with HIV, was
panicked. Feeling scared and alone, he announced to the group of strangers
that he&rsquo;d tested positive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>At the end of the meeting, David introduced himself.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be OK,&rdquo; he told Ralph.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to live.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>They started dating about six months later, and moved
together to the Bay Area in 2006, when Ralph, a veterinary surgeon, got a
job caring for animals in a research lab. They made new friends and started
a new life. They bought a small house and filled a large yard of tangled
gardens with dozens of animals. David found work at a private school in
Oakland. They were alive and they were healthy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>They&rsquo;re an odd couple, a fact both acknowledge
and enjoy. David, 57, often seems laid-back &ndash; he wears well the
rumpled look of an artist &ndash; but has the spit and fire of a New
Yorker. Ralph, 56, is small and compact, his sharp eyes serious behind his
glasses. He&rsquo;s quiet until he&rsquo;s not, and then will tell his life
story, slipping in wry details without cracking a smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The cribbage game that night made it clear something
was wrong with Ralph. He&rsquo;d lost his job a few months before, and
David had figured it was just a layoff due to the economy. Ralph later
admitted he&rsquo;d been struggling at work, needing a calculator to add
grams as he measured drugs for his animals. He&rsquo;d told himself it was
just from getting older, and if it was something more serious, it
wasn&rsquo;t anything he wanted to think too hard about.</span></p>

<p class="c0">
	<span>They saw the first doctor in February 2013, kicking off
	months of testing and visits with specialists.</span>
	<span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_hand').style.display='block'">Finally, Ralph was diagnosed with HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span>HAND can occur when HIV breaches the nervous system.
Most people experience relatively mild cognitive symptoms that can impair
memory, language and decision-making skills, but can still go about their
daily lives. Ralph has a more severe form that causes dementia, and is
ultimately fatal. Before he dies, he will lose the ability to walk, to
speak, to bathe or feed himself. His prognosis, doctors say, is five to
seven more years.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>David has taken ownership of Ralph&rsquo;s medical
care, working for months to get him on disability. To deal with his stress,
David paints -- portraits and scenes from their life, splashy, colorful
oils that are both painful and beautiful to view.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>There are days no one but David can tell there is
anything off about Ralph. Other days, Ralph clearly struggles for words,
clutches at memories that are slipping away. He can drive and shop, clean
the house and care for their animals. But a few months ago, David realized
that Ralph had stopped cooking lunch for himself. He was afraid of starting
a fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Ralph would gladly take an experimental medicine
&ndash; anything that might help him and add to research around his
dementia. &ldquo;If there was a clinical trial I&rsquo;d go on it,&rdquo;
he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go on all of them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>But there are no drugs that can save Ralph &ndash; not
yet. After the global AIDS community fought so hard to find antiretrovirals
and other drugs to fight HIV, it feels to David that long-term survivors
like himself and Ralph have been left adrift.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Still, David has seen miracles. That he&rsquo;s alive
today is one. So he tells himself a lot can happen in the time doctors say
Ralph has left.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;On some level I don&rsquo;t lose heart,&rdquo;
David says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide for myself that it&rsquo;s over and
done.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">I</span>n a drab corner conference room in a city building at
Van Ness Avenue and Market Street, Jesus Guillen and a dozen other AIDS
survivors arrange themselves in faded chairs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Jesus has been anticipating this afternoon for months.
His group is here to meet with San Francisco&rsquo;s Long-Term Care
Coordinating Council, an advisory group to Mayor Ed Lee on care for the
city&rsquo;s elderly and disabled. It&rsquo;s the first time they&rsquo;ll
have the mayor&rsquo;s ear</span><span class="c8">,</span> <span>indirect
though it may be.</span></p>

<p class="c0">
	<span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_needs').style.display='block'">The meeting begins, and the group lays out a list of
	demands: help with housing, improved mental health services, better access
	to health care, help with legal, financial and employment services.</span>
	<span>To start a needs assessment survey of older survivors and boost
	mental health aid, they say, would cost $165,000.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span>The council members make a few simple inquiries,
there&rsquo;s some polite discussion, and then a vote. The council agrees
unanimously to take their requests to the mayor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>But then a question: Why aren&rsquo;t you asking for
more? the council members say. What they&rsquo;ve requested amounts to just
$27.50 for each of the city&rsquo;s 6,000 long-term survivors. Surely
that&rsquo;s far from enough.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The men at the table nod. A few mutter that
they&rsquo;re setting their sights too low. Jesus sits quietly, surprised
by the council&rsquo;s reaction but not showing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The man who led the presentation, Vince Crisostomo,
speaks up. The time will come when they&rsquo;ll aim higher, he tells the
council. First, though, they need assurance that someone is really
listening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It hasn&rsquo;t been easy to rouse his fellow
survivors, he says. At the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, where he leads an
informal support group, he&rsquo;s sometimes asked if anyone thinks
they&rsquo;re worth the effort. Maybe it would be easier to just ignore
them and let them die, they say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Yes, you matter, he tells them. You&rsquo;re the last
of your generation. You hold all of its memories, all of its
history.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I tell them they need to speak up,&rdquo; he
tells the council. &ldquo;What good did it do to survive if you&rsquo;re
just going to sit in a room and let life pass you by?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Some of these men fought in the AIDS battles of the
1980s and 1990s. They protested in San Francisco and in Washington D.C.,
screaming for attention, for treatment, for resources and
support.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Back then,</span> <span>the</span><span>&nbsp;federal
government</span> <span>allowed homophobia to guide policy, doing little
to</span> <span>inform the public or fund basic research. But in San
Francisco, pleas for aid were rewarded with support from city and public
health leaders. That established a grassroot network of care, called the
San Francisco Model, now emulated worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The model blended health and support services that
provided compassionate care to patients often treated as outcasts
elsewhere. A</span><span>IDS wards &ndash; the first of their kind in the
country &ndash; opened at San Francisco General
Hospital.</span><span>&nbsp;Around them rose a web of nonprofit agencies,
created largely by the gay community itself.</span></p>

<p class="c0">
	<span>In the decades since, the needs of those earliest
	victims &mdash; and that model of care &mdash; have changed.</span>
	<span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_prevention').style.display='block'">The focus has shifted to prevention and rapid treatment for younger

<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;We as community are starting to have awareness.
More will happen,&rdquo; says Supervisor Scott Wiener, whose district
includes the Castro. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re in the early stages, and
we&rsquo;re definitely behind.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Jesus wasn&rsquo;t an activist back in the
epidemic&rsquo;s early days. But over the past several years, watching so
many of his peers struggle, he has been moved to act.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As he slipped through middle age, he started thinking
of his grandparents and other elders, of how much he admired and respected
them when he was young. He doesn&rsquo;t sense that admiration from the gay
community, not even in San Francisco. He hates to see men who already have
struggled so much enter what should be a time of peace and appreciation
instead feeling tossed aside.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Creating the list of demands for the mayor&rsquo;s
advisors was important work, but it often felt futile, too. Jesus and the
other survivors spent months talking passionately about their needs among
themselves, but no one else -- no one who could actually accomplish
anything -- seemed to be listening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Going before the council was a critical step. But he
wonders what, if anything, will happen next.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Some of the things we mention now
are the same things that we mentioned five years ago. And they never went
anywhere,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In the last three months of 2015, Jesus lost three
friends, all of them long-term survivors in their 50s or 60s, all to heart
attacks. It feels like time is running out, he says. His generation
can&rsquo;t afford to wait anymore to be noticed, to hope someone else will
help.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You may not call it HIV or AIDS, but to me
it&rsquo;s still the same thing. Maybe it&rsquo;s not as fast as before,
but I am seeing people still dying. It&rsquo;s still happening,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a lot we need to do.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Greene is lying on a red granite rock at the edge
of Tahquitz Canyon, head pillowed on his daypack, booted feet dangling over
the edge, eyes squinting into a perfect blue sky. Below him is the desert,
the oasis of Palm Springs tucked neatly into the valley.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; Peter says, closing his eyes as if
he could nap right there, &ldquo;is a nice day. I&rsquo;m out here and the
sky is blue and I feel good. I can&rsquo;t think about the next day. Or the
day after that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It&rsquo;s a week before Christmas, and in a few days
he&rsquo;ll drive his pickup 500 miles north, back to San Francisco. Peter
has lived in Palm Springs for two years now, ever since he lost his
apartment in the Castro. He has a mobile home that friends helped him buy.
It&rsquo;s small but charming, tucked against the base of a mountain,
walking distance from the canyon where he likes to hike.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>There&rsquo;s a community of older gay men here in the
desert, many of them AIDS survivors like Peter, looking for someplace
peaceful and affordable to settle down. But Peter still feels like a
stranger here. He doesn&rsquo;t like the quiet monotony; doesn&rsquo;t feel
suited to desert life. But more than anything, he says, he just misses
home.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I was banished from the kingdom I
knew.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Being pushed out of San Francisco, out of his community
in the Castro, was a terrible blow. He had to pack up nearly 30 years of
memories, scattering things he couldn&rsquo;t take with him among friends.
He&rsquo;s living on a fixed income from Social Security disability. Now,
Voyager, relocated in a smaller office loaned by a longtime
client</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>and run remotely, barely
covers its operating costs.</span></p>

<p class="c0">
	<span class="sidebar" title="Click for more info" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('aids_housing').style.display='block'">Finding affordable housing in the city is hardly a
	problem unique to AIDS survivors.</span>
	<span>But the consequences of
	losing a reasonably priced apartment can be especially grim for them.
	Peter&rsquo;s doctors, intimately familiar with his long and complex
	medical history, are now a day&rsquo;s drive away. So are support services
	that don&rsquo;t exist elsewhere. He can&rsquo;t easily volunteer for the
	agencies he&rsquo;s worked with for a decade or more, and he&rsquo;s
	separated from his closest, oldest friends, the dwindling remains of his
	social network.</span>
</p>

<p class="c0"><span>Every few weeks Peter makes a trip back home, bunking
with friends who have spare bedrooms or couches. Over the Christmas
holidays, when he volunteered with the AIDS Emergency Fund, he stayed on a
friend&rsquo;s empty houseboat in Sausalito. He scheduled doctors&rsquo;
appointments and two medical procedures. He stopped by Martuni&rsquo;s, the
Market Street karaoke bar that he&rsquo;s haunted for decades, singing with
pianists who know his favorites.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In Palm Springs, he spends most of his days focused on
how to get back to San Francisco, as impossible as that now seems. At 61,
it&rsquo;s hitting him all over again that he&rsquo;s running out of time
-- not because of AIDS, not because he&rsquo;s going to die young, but
because he faces the same end game everyone does at his age.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a purpose here,&rdquo; he
says. &ldquo;And I want the time I have left to matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It would be easy, after all the years of struggle and
heartache, to give up, give in. But Peter tries to reach for joy and
gratitude. Living more than half his life shadowed by AIDS has forced him
to live as most people probably don&rsquo;t, he says. To grasp the moment.
To embrace what is precious. Like a beautiful day in a beautiful place
that, for now, has to be home.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;For me, the HIV story is full of woe, but I
don&rsquo;t want that to be the message,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There was
suffering. But you can see, I&rsquo;m having a nice day. And this is the
moment, and we&rsquo;re all walking, talking, eating. We can go traveling
again. Hopefully there&rsquo;s more of that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">K</span>evin VandenBergh got to the Episcopal Church of St.
John the Evangelical before the music started. It was a warm Thursday
night, and he was among the first to arrive for a casual dinner-dance for
long-term survivors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He&rsquo;d decided to go on a whim. Though he&rsquo;d
been venturing out a little more in recent weeks, depression was still a
constant distraction; he still thought about suicide, hadn&rsquo;t
abandoned his plan. But he&rsquo;d resolved to try to engage
again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As always, he was nervous; hands shaking, talking a bit
too fast. He almost walked out. But then a man he&rsquo;d met once or twice
before took him by the arm and steered him to a table. Within a few
minutes, he&rsquo;d convinced Kevin to march with a contingent of long-term
survivors in the Pride Parade a few days later.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Soon Kevin was dancing, feeling over-stimulated but
happy that he&rsquo;d stepped outside his quiet, lonely life. He danced for
a few hours before leaving, but had gone only half a block when a familiar
song lured him back inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It was &ldquo;I Will Survive,&rdquo; a song he&rsquo;d
loved to dance to at clubs in his native Chicago in the early 1980s. Later,
he&rsquo;d smile sheepishly at how fitting the song was. But in the moment,
the song and the happy memories it carried made him want to celebrate just
a little longer. When the lights in the church finally came up hours later,
Kevin was still there -- sweat-drenched, beaming, one of a handful of men
still on the dance floor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Three days later he marched in the Pride Parade,
holding up a banner declaring &ldquo;Love Heals.&rdquo; Carrying the other
end of the banner was John, a man Kevin had met at the dance. They&rsquo;d
clicked; Kevin made John laugh. They marched down Market Street together,
Kevin cheering himself hoarse, waving at the crowds and pumping his fist in
the air.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>When the parade dumped them in Civic Center Plaza, they
were swallowed by the crowd. Kevin reached for John so they wouldn&rsquo;t
lose each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;And all of a sudden I realized, we were holding
hands,&rdquo; Kevin says. It&rsquo;s weeks later, but his eyes are bright
with the memory. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the last time I held
someone&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">S</span>ome days, Ganymede can hardly believe that he got
another chance to fall in love, that he has built a new family &ndash;
vibrant Cullen to argue and laugh with, Warren to bake chocolate chip
cookies on a too-hot summer day.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Soft-voiced but firm, his long gray hair pulled back
into a loose ponytail and a ring through his nose, Ganymede exudes a quiet
but insistent energy, an undeniable authority. He&rsquo;s the orbital
center of his family in the hills. A few of his friends call him &ldquo;St.
Ganymede,&rdquo; Cullen says with an eyeroll. Ganymede teases that Cullen
is &ldquo;the minister&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It&rsquo;s clear, though, that Ganymede is more fragile
than his partners. Neuropathy makes walking difficult; scars from a skin
infection brought on by immunotherapy drugs cover his shins.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>His body is stiff, painful, and he&rsquo;s easily
fatigued. When he struggles to get up from a chair, the others pretend not
to notice. Cullen and Warren do almost all the cooking and cleaning, and
Ganymede often can&rsquo;t help feeling useless in his own home.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>His libido has faded too. He misses some of the
activities that were once so key to his spirituality, though he&rsquo;s
still has sex and has found comfort in a gentler sort of physical
intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 59,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but I feel
closer to 70.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Ganymede tries to be patient with himself and his
infirmity. Every morning, when he wakes to the aches in his legs, he tells
himself to be grateful. To choose to be happy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I get to go through the awful process of aging
with this disease that literally 100 of my friends never got to do,&rdquo;
he says. &ldquo;They never got the chance to do even
this.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen David Spiher proposed to Ralph Thurlow in late
2013, Ralph responded with a quick and sincere no. He knew too many people
with terrible marriages. Yet just a few months later, on Valentine&rsquo;s
Day, Ralph proposed to David.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>He&rsquo;d forgotten to buy a gift, David says with a
grin. Ralph says he doesn&rsquo;t remember that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>They married on July 25, in a simple ceremony with 50
friends and family members on a sunny afternoon at the zen center they
attend in Berkeley. The grooms both wore white shirts and pants, with
prayer beads around their necks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In the corner of the room was a three-tiered cake
shaped like the mountains around Yosemite Valley, a place they both love.
Over one side spilled a blue frosting waterfall, and perched on top was a
3D-printed sculpture made by an artist friend: David and Ralph sitting
side-by-side in a rowboat, their hands grasping each other&rsquo;s knees.
The boat was suspended over the edge of the waterfall, against the current;
their backs were turned to the turbulent, unknown future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>David gently guided Ralph through parts of the
ceremony, whispering reminders to bow or turn, to grasp hands during the
vows. Maybe it was just wedding day nerves.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>These are not young men, the zen master said as he
began the service. The crowd chuckled, and the grooms smiled too.
&ldquo;These are two men who have lived a life,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;who understand the sadness and the suffering that&rsquo;s connected
with the deep well of love and passion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Probably the most important thing in a marriage
is to be big enough to hold everything. If we can hold it then we&rsquo;re
not afraid of it. Please, in your marriage, hold your whole experience. All
of it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Acknowledge and reflect on the largeness of life, the
zen master advised them. Then live it, day to day, breath to
breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; he asked the grooms.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;We can,&rdquo; David said, his eyes on Ralph.
Ralph paused. &ldquo;We can,&rdquo; he echoed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You can?&rdquo; the zen master said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>David laughed. &ldquo;We do.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; Ralph said, only a breath
behind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In a life defined by a plague and measured in loss and
pain, in fear and loneliness, sometimes it&rsquo;s the smallest steps
forward, the briefest moments of gratitude, that matter most. Waking up to
the sunlight. Taking someone&rsquo;s hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Saying yes.</span></p>
