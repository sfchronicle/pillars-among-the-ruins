<p class="lede"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Greene is 60, his beard run through with gray. His eyes are a piercing blue, and on a good day his smile is quick and charming, easily calling back the athletic young man who hitchhiked to San Francisco with dreams of adventure more than three decades ago.</p><p>
But on a sunny summer afternoon in the Castro, sitting outside the travel agency he co-founded with his business partner, Jonathan Klein, Peter is exhausted. </p><p>
“I saw one of the great world epidemics unfold in front of my eyes,” he says. “I have to carry that with me the rest of my life.”</p><p>
Inside the agency, a large framed photo shows Peter tucked into a rickshaw with Jonathan. They’re close, arms around one another. Peter’s grin looks like he was caught mid-laughter, Jonathan’s smile smaller but warm. They look like they could be lovers.</p><p>
Peter is just 28 in the photo, from a 1983 bike tour through China that he organized for a group of gay cyclists. Peter and Jonathan bonded on that trip and when they returned to San Francisco they went into business together.</p><p>
There was no romance between them, but they were partners and dear friends. And together, they were survivors.</p><p>
The two men tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS just two years after the bike tour, in the nascent days of the epidemic.  In San Francisco, AIDS was ruthless and ruinous, gutting a generation of young gay men. And left behind were their shattered friends and lovers, the men who had the remarkable luck – and, at times, brutal misfortune – to survive.</p><p>
Peter and Jonathan fought AIDS for half of their lives, and by almost any measure, they had won. They’d lived, even as the circle of death tightened around them. They lost high school friends and first loves.</p><p>
There’s another photo from that gay bike tour, a group of eight cyclists posed around a rainbow flag on the Great Wall of China. Half of the young men in the photo are dead now.</p><p>
“That’s the hardest part of this epidemic, the loneliness of having lost,” Peter says. “I don’t want to be the last man standing.”</p><p>
That loss has been cruelly unremitting.</p><p>
On a cold April morning in 2013 – 30 years after the photo in China – Jonathan Klein drove to the north end of the Golden Gate Bridge, parked his car, walked back out on the span and jumped to his death.</p>

<p>They were artists and lawyers and musicians and doctors. They were bartenders and drugstore clerks and teachers and students. They were exploring sex and drugs and politics, and they were still growing up. They were 25 and falling in love for the first time. They were 35 and just hitting their stride.</p><p>
The loss to society of so much promise can never be calculated. But AIDS didn’t just kill, it maimed the futures of the survivors who came of age under a death sentence.</p><p>
They weren’t supposed to live past 40. Now they’re 50, 60, 70 years old, physically and psychically and spiritually damaged, and they are alone.</p>
<p>San Francisco was, and remains, the cultural center of the country’s gay community, and as such, the city suffered more acute damage from AIDS than anywhere else in the United States. Though cities like New York and Los Angeles had higher death counts, in San Francisco the casualties were so much more concentrated. AIDS was never solely the bane of gay men, and it’s infected and killed tens of thousands of straight men, women and transgender people in the United States. But in San Francisco, the weight of the scourge was borne by the men who’d settled in a 2-square-mile enclave in the heart of the city, the Castro.</p>

<aside class="inline-asset inline-asset-left" id="two">
    <p>By the peak of the AIDS epidemic in 1992, nearly 9,500 people had died, mostly young gay men. In the darkest, deadliest years, 30 people were dying from AIDS every week. Those living among the plague lost dozens of friends and multiple lovers. They witnessed young bodies ravaged by awful, sometimes disfiguring disease, all the while knowing that they likely faced the same fate.</p>

Some of these men have managed to thrive despite their diagnosis. By a trick of genetics or luck of a weak viral strain, they maintained their health and they kept their jobs and their homes. They have retirement plans and they found partners who either survived too or never became infected. Some have raised families and maintained active social lives.</p><p>
For the others, survival came at a great cost, and as they enter years when other men their age start to think about retirement and sending children off to college and settling down for some peace, these men are facing new battles. They’re fighting to keep their homes or find affordable housing on a fixed income, in an exploding market. Over the next decade or so, as they turn 65, many will need financial aid when they lose disability benefits that have been their primary means of support for almost all of their adult lives.</p>
<p>
Survivors are dealing with anxiety and depression from the years of fear and sorrow that they endured. Many desperately need mental health services. They’re angry and despondent. They’re isolated.</p><p>
Some have hope – they’re fighting, too. They’re turning to art and music to express the trauma they’ve endured. They’re looking for jobs or going back to school. But they’re scarcely able to catch up in a world that’s left them behind.</p>
<p>
Twenty years after AIDS stopped being a death sentence, the survivors who staggered from the ruins of a scorched generation are struggling to live.</p><p>
…</p>
<p>Now, 20 years after HIV became a treatable, survivable disease, and as the city and country push aggressive campaigns to stop all new infections and eradicate AIDS, the survivors wonder what becomes of them. No one expected them to be here.</p>
<aside class="inline-asset">
    <p>
    It’s unclear how many long-term survivors of AIDS live in San Francisco or the wider Bay Area, and their needs are not well defined. Of the 16,000 people with AIDS or HIV, the virus that causes it, more than half are age 50 or older, and most of that group became infected during the worst of the epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s. Several thousand gay men in San Francisco have been living with HIV or AIDS for more than 20 years.</p>

<p>
Mr. Gay Colorado packed his bags and hitched out west to San Francisco in 1977. Peter Greene was 22, a New York City native, and he’d just graduated from the University of Colorado in Boulder.</p><p>
His Tom Selleck mustache and toned, athletic body won him the pageant title in a barroom stunt, and Peter enthusiastically embraced the magazine cover and local fame that came along with it. He’d come out in college and he was confident and fearless when he arrived in San Francisco, a city exploding with political and cultural gay life.</p><p>
In 1977, Harvey Milk was elected the first openly gay supervisor in San Francisco, and the city hosted its first International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. The Castro was blossoming as gay business owners congregated there, opening bars and clubs, bookshops and restaurants. Men, single and in couples, were settling there too, buying homes and renting rooms in the classic Victorians in the former working-class neighborhood.</p><p>
For Peter and other young gay men, so many of whom came to San Francisco from parts of the country where living openly was out of the question, the Castro and the rest of the city was a feast of freedom and opportunity. Men could hold hands on the sidewalk or flirt openly in gay bars with clear-glass windows facing the street. In the clubs and bathhouses they could have sex with whomever, whenever, free of judgment or shame.</p><p>
“It wasn’t just a Sodom and Gomorrah as they like to paint San Francisco,” Peter said. “We were all just young kids trying to figure out who we were. And it quickly came to an end.”</p><p>
He thinks there’s a very good chance he was infected with HIV within a year or two, maybe just months, of his arrival.</p><p>
…</p><p>
By the time doctors were seeing the first cases of a mysterious disease attacking gay men, Harry Breaux thinks he’d probably had sex with 1,000 men. “It may be only 600,” he says. “I don’t think that is outrageous.”</p><p>
AIDS was a silent, not yet deadly presence in San Francisco for years before its first recorded appearance. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, likely was carried into the United States in the 1960s, and its long incubation period -- some people can be infected with HIV for more than a decade before becoming symptomatic -- meant it could circulate easily without carriers knowing it even existed.
</p><p>
So the virus spread without notice among the great gay migration that was driving young men to San Francisco and building a Castro boomtown.</p><p>
The 1970s were an exciting, explosive time for gay rights, and a new, live-out-loud generation was coalescing around political touchstones -- the Stonewall Riots in New York City, attacks on gay rights in California and the rest of the country, and in San Francisco, the killing of Supervisor Milk alongside Mayor George Moscone in 1978.</p><p>
Harry was in his 30s when he first began frequenting the Castro, on weekend sojourns from the rural Oregon cooperative where he lived. He was dazzled by the entire scene: the politics and culture, the free sex and love.</p><p>
For Harry, coming out had been a slow, at times awful experience, fraught with shame and fear. When he was in sixth grade, he got caught trying to perform oral sex on another boy and his parents sent him to military school.</p><p>
Harry thrived under the structure. He did well in school and sports and was popular. He pushed back all thoughts about other boys. No one knew he was gay, and he knew of no other boys who were gay.</p><p>
After he graduated, the draft was pending and Harry thought to get ahead of it and apply for an officer training commission. A routine physical found a mild kidney problem, and Harry says he was told that the condition would prevent him from becoming an officer, but still allow him to serve.</p><p>
Furious and hurt, Harry demanded back his enlistment form.</p><p>
“I remember it was question No. 30. It said ‘homosexual tendencies,’” Harry said. “The first time, I said no.”</p><p>
He checked the box that said “yes” instead, and handed the form back to the recruiter, who asked if he was sure that was how he wanted to answer the question. Harry was sure.</p><p>
…</p><p>
The first public record of AIDS came in June 1981 in a report issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report documented five cases of pneumocystis pneumonia -- a rare bacterial infection in the lungs -- in young gay men in Los Angeles.</p><p>
San Francisco had seen cases too by then, along with reports of cancers and other strange infections in gay men. It wasn’t long before doctors around the country decided that an infectious agent was being spread among gay men, but San Francisco was one of the first, and certainly the most aggressive, cities to respond to the advancing epidemic.</p><p>
Long before most gay men were fully aware of the crisis that would dominate and define their generation, health care providers in San Francisco were watching patients die. There were almost no treatments. Once someone was symptomatic, he would almost certainly be dead within a year or two.</p><p>
San Francisco General Hospital opened the first AIDS inpatient ward in the country in July 1983, and a few months later the first outpatient clinic, Ward 86. Everyone who worked in the clinics volunteered for their job. Many of the nurses who staffed those wards were gay men and lesbians who wanted to care for their own.</p><p>
Even in those earliest years, the front-line workers knew they were participants in what would be a brutal but historic epidemic. In the inpatient Ward 5a, the nurses made a scrapbook to document their experiences.</p><p>
Among the Polaroid photos and the thank-you cards from families is a list of names. It starts on the first page, with the first 28 men who died on the ward. Each name is carefully handwritten and prominently displayed.</p><p>
Flip a few pages and the names are so small they’re hard to read, the letters tightly scrawled to fit more deaths on each page.</p><p>
...</p><p>
For the gay men of San Francisco, their introduction to AIDS might have been reports in The Chronicle or a handful of other news sources in the early 1980s. Or they saw the flyers posted on the side of Star Pharmacy -- now the Walgreens on Castro and 18th streets -- by Bobbi Campbell, the self-proclaimed “poster child” of AIDS who took it on himself to warn his community after he was diagnosed in 1981.</p><p>
But for most men, AIDS was just a shadow in their periphery until suddenly it hit home. Many would hear rumors about friends of friends becoming sick, or they’d notice that their favorite bartender had suddenly disappeared, either dead or returned to his family home to die. They’d see young men on the street walking with canes, their bodies stooped and wasted from fighting one infection after another.</p><p>
Then one day a lover or close friend would come home from a doctor’s appointment with bad news.</p><p>
“I was living with it every day,” said Ganymede, who sailed into San Francisco Bay with his lover Alain in 1984, when he was 28.</p><p>
Ganymede was born and raised in Sacramento, and though he’d always known he was gay, it wasn’t until college in San Diego that he discovered a profound interest in sex and spirituality and exploring physical intimacy outside the mainstream. He changed his name -- he was born Jeffrey Andrews -- and began seeking other men who shared his interests.</p><p>
In the Bay Area with Alain, he built a community of gay men, and a few women, around those beliefs. They joined the pioneers of San Francisco’s leather scene, holding sex parties and weekend retreats in the mountains.</p><p>
His community became his family, and that family was gutted by AIDS.</p><p>
Ganymede lost dozens of people in the ‘80s and early ‘90s; he’s never tried to count all the names. He had always ministered to the spiritual needs of his community, and so he was called to dying friends’ bedsides, where he’d pray or meditate with them through their last breaths.</p><p>
“I held their hands while they died, I gave them last rites, I counseled and consoled their families and friends,” he said. “I had a huge amount of grief.”</p><p>
Alain and Ganymede tested positive for HIV in 1986, the same year they bought a house in the Oakland Hills. But Alain quickly got sick while Ganymede remained healthy.</p><p>
“I spoon-fed him water on the day he died,” Ganymede said.</p><p>
…</p><p>
Jesus Guillen was sitting in his mother’s kitchen in Guadalajara, her back to him as she cooked at a hot stove, when he told her he had AIDS.</p><p>
He’d flown to her home from San Francisco so he could tell her in person. He was nervous, making inane conversation, and then he said, all in a rush, “by the way, I’m HIV positive.”</p><p>
She stood silent for a long time. Then she began to cry, her shoulders shaking, and he got up and held her.</p><p>
“I told her I was OK. In that particular moment I was OK,” he said. “And the rest, I didn’t know for sure.”</p><p>
Twenty-five years later, on a sunny June afternoon, recalling that moment still makes both of them cry. Dolores Solis is visiting her son and his living rooms smells of the fresh tortillas she made that morning and the mint they plucked from his garden. Jesus hands her a tissue and she dabs at her eyes.</p><p>
Solis didn’t know much about HIV at the time, but she knew that people with AIDS died quickly, and her son was only 31. “I was very afraid,” she says. Even now, she still worries that he’ll die before she does, and the thought of it brings more tears.</p><p>
HIV was identified as the virus that causes AIDS in 1984, and within a year the first blood tests became available. But whether or not to get tested was not an easy decision.</p><p>
Testing negative would be a relief, but a positive result could cast only fear and confusion. There were no treatments for AIDS in 1985, and there wouldn’t be any lifesaving drugs for another decade.</p><p>
Though doctors and public health experts understood that AIDS extended far beyond the gay community, to the general public, a positive test in the 1980s was basically the same as being gay. For Jesus and many others, who were living only marginally out in the open, that wasn’t something they were prepared to reveal.</p><p>
Jesus grew up in a town of just 200 people in central Mexico. One of six kids, he was the passionate one, the artist and the performer, although shy as a child and teenager. When he came to the United States in 1984 he was 24, and he walked right through the border crossing at Tijuana. He moved to Los Angeles and looked for acting and theater work.</p><p>
He had always known he was gay but had kept it strictly to himself in Mexico, afraid his family would disapprove.</p><p>
In Los Angeles, Jesus began dating. He’d heard of the gay cancer, and he was afraid of it. He got tested in 1986, not because he thought he could be infected but because he needed to know that he was OK.</p><p>
“They told me it was positive,” Jesus said. “After that I think I did my test five times.”</p><p>
He told no one that he was infected. For a year Jesus held onto his secret, and it would have been longer if not for President Reagan’s immigration act, which offered amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants in 1987. But the application included a blood test, and Jesus knew the United States would not allow an HIV-positive immigrant to stay.</p><p>
Jesus waited, terrified, until a day or two before the deadline. He gathered his courage and approached a close friend, and he asked for an incredible favor.</p><p>
“I had to ask him to do that test for me, that blood test. I didn’t know what else to do,” Jesus said. “It was not only coming out to him, but to ask something like that – I owe him so much.”</p><p>
....</p><p>
The human immunodeficiency virus causes AIDS -- an acronym for acquired immunodeficiency disorder -- by targeting and killing a particular kind of immune cell, called a T-cell. When enough of these T-cells are gone, the body becomes vulnerable to diseases called, collectively, opportunistic infections.</p><p>
For the immune-weakened in the years before AIDS treatments arrived, these infections could be gruesome and painful, and ultimately they were deadly. Cytomegalovirus attacked the eyes and often left patients blind before they died. Pneumocystis pneumonia settled in the lungs. Toxoplasmosis got into the brain, and caused memory loss and confusion.</p><p>
Kaposi’s sarcoma -- not an infection, but a cancer that manifested as purple lesions on the skin -- quickly became the most obvious and disfiguring sign of AIDS, and patients would sometimes hide themselves away when the blemishes appeared on their arms and legs, or their faces.</p><p>
Victims could lose a third or more of their weight from the wasting effects of AIDS. Their cheeks would sag and hollow, their frames wilt. They could get thrush, a fungal infection that formed a white rash in the mouth and throat. AIDS made them more vulnerable to other sexually transmitted infections.[a]</p><p>
These days, people are diagnosed with AIDS when their T-cell count drops below a certain level. But in the years before HIV was discovered and scientists understood what they were looking for in a patient’s blood, doctors diagnosed AIDS when someone had an opportunistic infection. By then, death was almost certain.</p><p>
When the HIV tests did come out, many men took a positive result as a death sentence, and their doctors often did little to discourage that line of thinking. Men were told to make the most of what would likely be their final months or years. Many were advised to leave work on disability right away, or cash in life insurance policies or other savings if they had them.</p><p>
…</p><p>
Sometimes there wasn’t even time to say goodbye.</p><p>
In summer 1986, Harry Breaux was walking down Castro Street, a day or two before the Pride parade, when he ran into a friend from high school. Harry and Don Denney grinned and embraced, each surprised to see the other in San Francisco. Harry had always thought he was the only gay student at their military school. Denney had thought the same. It was a pleasant relief to realize they hadn’t been quite so alone.</p><p>
Denney had moved to the Bay Area long ago and was living in Sebastopol with a boyfriend, raising champion irises. He and Harry exchanged phone numbers and made plans to catch up when they had more time.</p><p>
Two years later, the AIDS Memorial Quilt was on display in San Francisco, and Harry went to see it for the first time. Walking among the quilt, trying to absorb the huge amount of loss and grief it represented, a panel caught his eye. It was a simple blue block with a beautiful, vibrant iris and a name.</p><p>
Don Denny had died on Aug. 15, 1986. They never did get to reconnect.</p><p>
…</p><p>
Twenty-four years ago, a storefront at 2362 Market St. that’s now a popular seafood restaurant served as a rented workshop for the AIDS Quilt. It was where Joanie Juster first witnessed the vast wreckage of AIDS.</p><p>
Joanie started working in San Francisco theater in the late 1970s, and she’d been quietly concerned for her friends and coworkers when the first reports of AIDS began to surface. She knew one person who was diagnosed in 1983, and over time she heard of others -- a young friend who died suddenly after moving away, names she recognized in the obituaries in the Bay Area Reporter.</p><p>
And then there was DW. David Wachsnicht was a waiter, and they met at a cabaret where Joanie worked in the back offices.</p><p>
“DW was a pistol,” she said. “Tiny little guy, but quick-witted, funny, constantly smoking. He could pour a margarita like no one.”</p><p>
DW called Joanie one night and told her he had pneumonia. It was 1988, and by then Joanie knew the code. Pneumonia in a young gay man in the 1980s was pneumocystis. And pneumocystis meant AIDS, and that meant DW was dying.</p><p>
Joanie went to his apartment and they packed up his belongings so DW could go home to his parents’ house in Kansas to die. They laughed and they cried as they tossed around his collection of loud Hawaiian shirts. And when he did die, Joanie used those shirts to make a quilt panel for him.</p><p>
She’d heard about the AIDS Quilt. It was a traveling memorial created by a San Francisco man, Cleve Jones, as a way for friends and family to honor loved ones lost to AIDS. She knew that the quilt would be displayed in Washington D.C. soon, and that she had a week to make a panel for DW. She wasn’t an artist and she didn’t sew, but she was determined to make the deadline.</p><p>
She had until midnight on a Saturday in October, and when she arrived at that Market Street storefront it was 12:02 a.m. The lights were already out and the door was locked. Joanie wept out of frustration, and she pounded on the door. Someone came and brought her inside, and turned on a light.</p><p>
“I looked around, and the whole front of the workshop by the windows was piled eight feet high with FedEx boxes,” Joanie said. “And I knew each one was a quilt. It was like this graveyard.”</p><p>
She knew, then, what this city -- what her friends, men who felt like family -- were up against.</p><p>
…</p><p>
In the 15 years before scientists found drugs to attack HIV, the mortality rate from AIDS was terrifying. By 1988, some epidemiology reports suggested close to 100 percent of people diagnosed with AIDS would die from it within five years, according to the CDC.</p><p>
But no one knew how long someone who was just infected with the virus, and not yet symptomatic of AIDS, could survive. Doctors couldn’t even say whether everyone who tested positive would eventually develop AIDS at all. Later, they’d learn that HIV could incubate for a decade or more, and that up to 10 percent of people were able to fight off the virus entirely with no sign of AIDS.</p><p>
In 1987, Kevin VandenBergh was 26 years old and eager to start the next leg of his academic career. He’d earned a degree in English from the University of Chicago, keeping three jobs to pay for school and all the while winning praise from professors, who encouraged him to reach for a master’s degree and a PhD, maybe go into teaching himself someday, or write for a living.</p><p>
Then he tested positive.</p><p>
“My life skittered off,” he said, “and it’s been a disaster ever since.”</p><p>
Kevin saw little point in an advanced education if he wasn’t going to be around to take advantage of it. Instead, he got a job as an entry-level computer programmer. He figured he’d be dead by 35, and a job would provide him with health insurance and a steady income, and eventually disability insurance when his health turned and he couldn’t work anymore.</p><p>
The work was tedious and the office politics a constant source of anxiety. When he began experiencing odd neurological symptoms -- shaky hands, a stiff, awkward walk -- it was almost a relief. Doctors said he might have an AIDS-related infection in his brain. That was January 1994, and Kevin has been on disability ever since.</p><p>
He moved to San Francisco with a boyfriend shortly after leaving his job, and he lives now in a two-bedroom apartment above the Castro, with a roommate he doesn’t get along with.</p><p>
He never managed to get his life back on track after the HIV diagnosis, he says. He recently found a box with some of his old college essays and tortured himself reading the comments his professors had left about his talent as a writer and the future they saw laid out before him.</p><p>
“That was a life that I was supposed to at least try to have,” Kevin said. “To achieve something that I could be proud of.”</p><p>
...</p><p>
Just months after Peter Greene was diagnosed, his doctor died of AIDS.</p><p>
Peter watched friends die too. He sat with them in their bedrooms or in the hospital. He held the hands of strangers at Maitri, the hospice where he volunteered. By the time he tested positive, Peter was all too familiar with what AIDS would do to a man.</p><p>
Jonathan Klein, Peter recalls, went into a kind of quiet denial after they were diagnosed. They never talked much about HIV or AIDS. But Peter became obsessed with keeping himself alive. </p><p>
He signed up for every clinical trial that would take him, grabbed at every experimental drug he could find  — AZT, the early drug that offered the first real thread of hope but proved too weak to treat HIV alone; a Chinese cucumber extract called Compound Q that could cause patients to lapse into a coma; and some kind of algae, the name of which Peter’s long forgotten, that turned his urine blue.</p><p>
In 1989, Peter was one of the first patients to join Quest Clinical Research, then a clinic that was part of UCSF’s Mount Zion campus, though it’s now a private organization. It was started by a team of doctors and nurses who wanted to not just treat patients but participate in research into the experimental drugs that weren’t moving fast enough through the federal testing process.</p><p>
“He was probably patient No. 2,” says Eileen Glutzer, one of the founding nurses at Quest. She’s sitting beside Peter in her home near the Castro, recalling the first time they met.</p><p>
“You brought your boyfriend,” Glutzer says, trying to jog his memory.</p><p>
“Barry?” Peter says. She nods. “I took Barry in. But it was a little too late for him.”</p><p>
…</p><p>
By 1990, 4,963 people had died of AIDS in San Francisco, almost 90 percent of them gay men. The epidemic would peak in two years. A fatigue and depression had settled over the Castro.</p><p>
There was anger, too. In San Francisco and other major cities groups like ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) were protesting the slow response from federal and local governments, demanding more funding and better access to drugs and health care. Gay men set up black market “buyers’ clubs” to bring drugs not approved in the United States to AIDS sufferers desperate for any sort of treatment.</p><p>
On a national level, both gay rights activists and patient advocacy groups were trying to paint a new public picture of AIDS. It’s not a gay disease, they said. And it wasn’t. In the early 1990s, the public finally started to understand that straight men and women were at risk too, and that AIDS was a mainstream, global crisis.</p><p>
But in San Francisco, it was gay men who were -- and still are -- most vulnerable to AIDS. And in the absence of widespread public support, it was the gay community that stepped up and cared for its own. From their work, a system of care now known as the San Francisco Model emerged.</p><p>
A decade into the epidemic, the San Francisco Model had become a robust and thriving industry of nonprofit and public agencies, with an army of volunteers. Gay men and their allies donated time and money. They formed informal support groups and they helped clean homes and cook dinners for the sick and dying.</p><p>
Gay lawyers offered to help write wills for young men on their deathbeds. Gay animal lovers raised money to help feed and care for pets when their owners had to stop working. Gay activists created the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, the AIDS Emergency Fund and Project Inform, which helped build a system for getting treatments to everyone with HIV.</p><p>
Those activist years were alternately heartbreaking and inspiring. The Castro community came together in a swell of emotions. There was love and support for one another, and rage against the homophobia and stigma that threatened lives.[b]</p><p>
“AIDS was all about aiding each other and not getting aid from the people around us and the country and the government,” says Harry Breaux, who to this day carries deep anger against the government that he says let down his generation.</p><p>
“A huge betrayal in my life was the way the government stood up and did nothing. It just turned its back on us,” says Harry, his voice, softly accented by his Louisiana upbringing, taking on a fierce edge.</p><p>
Harry volunteered with the Shanti Project when the agency began offering emotional and practical support to AIDS sufferers. He sat with men who were sick, went to the hospital with them, listened to them when they needed to rail and vent against the indignities of a death by AIDS. His last client was Andrew Meltzer, the San Francisco Opera conductor who died in 1988 at age 40, in the prime of his career.</p><p>
After Meltzer’s death, Harry took off.</p><p>
“I ran. I just ran,” Harry says. “I look back and think I could have stayed, I could have taken care of more people. But I didn’t have that kind of makeup. I just couldn’t do it anymore.”</p><p>
He stayed away from San Francisco for several years, even after he was hospitalized with fevers that made him delirious and doctors diagnosed him with pneumocystis -- even after he had AIDS himself.</p><p>
…</p><p>
For other gay men San Francisco was still a refuge. In the 1990s, it wasn’t just a place to feel safe and welcome, but a place for survival. San Francisco has, since the beginning of the epidemic, been home to a corps of doctors and scientists who were tops in the field of AIDS treatment and research, and the Castro the center of a deep network of emotional and practical support.</p><p>
San Francisco was the “gay mecca” and Mick Robinson was determined to make it there in 1991. Born and raised in the suburbs of Washington D.C., he was used to not fitting in. His was the first black family in their neighborhood, and being gay on top of black was the “trump card” of alienation. He moved to California as soon as he could, to go to college at San Diego State University. But even there, his life was splintered.</p><p>
“Friday night was my straight night. Saturday night would be my gay night,” he said. The groups weren’t really all that different, but the straight crowd was into cocaine, and the gay crowd methamphetamine. It turned out Mick liked meth, a lot.</p><p>
Within a few years he was hooked and he’d started using intravenously. He dropped out of college, and eventually moved to Los Angeles where his life revolved entirely around supporting his drug habit. He can’t remember exactly when or how he realized he was in trouble, but sometime in the summer of 1986, he called his mom and asked for a plane ticket back to Maryland.</p><p>
Two weeks after returning to the East Coast, Mick attempted suicide. He woke up in a psych ward, angry at having survived and full of shame for how completely his life had fallen apart. Four days into his stay, a doctor pulled Mick into a private office.</p><p>
The doctor, Mick recalls, was “nervous and fidgety.” Finally he managed to confess that they’d tested Mick for HIV when he was brought to the hospital. Mick was 28. The doctor told him he had a year or two to live, maybe a couple more of if he was lucky.</p><p>
“He’s waiting for my reaction, and I get this big smile on my face,” Mick said. “My response was, ‘Oh great, I don’t have to try to kill myself again.’”[c]</p><p>
Life in the psych ward after he was diagnosed HIV-positive was miserable. Public fear of AIDS was peaking. Hospital staff pasted a “toxic” sign on the door to his private room. He was given his own eating utensils and cups for water, even his own ashtray. Nurses and orderlies would come into his room dressed head to toe in protective gear, their faces unreadable behind masks. The other patients quickly figured out he had HIV.[d]</p><p>
“I was totally ostracized,” he said. “Even the staff didn’t want to deal with me.”</p><p>
After his release, Mick was sent to a rehab program and HIV support group in which he was one of only two or three gay men and he still felt unwelcome. So he joined a predominantly gay program in Washington D.C., where he met a man named Paul who would become his lover.[e]</p><p>
In 1991, five years after he tested positive Mick was still alive. But the prognosis remained the same -- he was still going to die from AIDS, said doctors, and Mick believed them. He cashed in a retirement account from a job in Baltimore and he convinced his boyfriend they should move to California.</p><p>
If he was going to die, San Francisco was where he wanted to be.</p><p>
…</p><p>
AIDS could move excruciatingly slow and terrifyingly fast. Once someone got sick, the infections seemed to roll in one after another. Patients would cycle in and out of the hospital, and after each battle won, they’d emerge weaker and less able to fight.</p><p>
Barry was a “big, burly fisherman” when Peter met him at a bar in the Castro, not long after he’d moved to San Francisco.</p><p>
“He was sitting on one of these barstools, and I walked in and saw this stringy hair, these hands that were all hardened, and two casts. And my heart started beating,” Peter said. “And I said something like, ‘Are you with the ballet?’ Some stupid little thing.</p><p>
“I had sex that night with a fisherman with two casts on his legs.”</p><p>
Peter learned that same night that his catch was married, with two daughters. Barry spent most of his year fishing off the Aleutian Islands in the Bering Sea, sending money home to his family while he lived another life as a gay man in the Castro. </p><p>
Peter would sometimes fly up to Alaska for visits, but more often Barry would come to him, or they’d travel together. Peter eventually grew close to Barry’s daughters, and he’s come to know the grandchildren Barry never met.</p><p>
When Barry died in 1994, he was no longer Peter’s burly fisherman. He’d lost 100 pounds from wasting caused by AIDS. He was divorced by then, and Peter cared for him to the end.</p><p>
“It was horrible, just horrible,” Peter said, “to watch the person you care for go through that.”</p><p>
…</p><p>
When the first drugs to fight HIV and AIDS arrived in 1995, the effects were immediate and spectacular. After more than a decade of scientific research that produced only repeated disappointments -- mostly useless drugs, often with terrible side effects -- suddenly doctors had a treatment that stopped the virus and reversed the course of AIDS. Within two years, deaths from AIDS were cut in half.</p><p>
Antiretroviral drugs attack HIV at particular points in the virus’s life cycle, preventing it from reproducing in the body. First there was only one drug, but now there are dozens, and they’re almost always used in combination -- in a cocktail known as HAART, for highly active antiretroviral therapy -- to attack the virus on multiple fronts and to prevent drug resistance.</p><p>
The drugs don’t kill off all of the virus in the body and they aren’t a cure. Once people start taking antiretrovirals, they have to keep taking them or else risk the virus rearing up and wildly replicating again. But they prevent HIV from destroying the immune system and causing AIDS.</p><p>
Now, 20 years after the first antiretrovirals became available, doctors believe that with drug therapy people with HIV can live a near-normal lifespan.</p><p>
“I remember the day -- I remember the fax machine -- when the data came across that showed we had achieved sustained viral suppression,” said Dr. Diane Havlir, a long-time AIDS doctor and researcher who is chief of the HIV/AIDS division at San Francisco General Hospital.</p><p>
She was working in drug research at UC San Diego when the first successful antiretroviral reports came out. She’d heard rumors, from campus colleagues or from scientists at the AIDS conferences she attended several times a year, that the newest drug discoveries looked promising. But she’d heard that kind of optimism before and refused to get her hopes up.</p><p>
So that day -- walking into her office and hearing the fax machine warm up, seeing the pages come off the tray and the data so clear on the page -- was forever branded.</p><p>
“That, to me, was the turning point,” she said.[f]</p><p>
Now, there is hope.</p><p>
…</p><p>
In 1995, Ganymede ran to the hills.</p><p>
The deaths, finally, had slowed. The wave of suffering was starting to recede. Ganymede was 39 years old. Alain had been dead for three years and Ganymede was in love again. He and Steven were both HIV positive, but they were alive.</p><p>
They hadn’t been dating long when Ganymede talked Steven into leaving his Twin Peaks apartment and moving into his rambling home in the Oakland Hills, where they could nest, he said, and heal, far from the battlefield.</p><p>
They lived with a cat and with more memories than their home could hold. Steven was a hoarder, and Ganymede had his own mementos from the ones he’d lost. On the fireplace mantle and bookshelves, tucked into corners, were rich, sensuous sculptures that Alain had made when he’d turned to art in his illness.</p><p>
Steven was charismatic and joyful, clever and quick. Ganymede was warm and thoughtful and spiritual. In their home in the hills, amid the trees and their gardens, they pulled away from the family of friends they’d relied on through the worst years, and they leaned into each other.</p><p>
They had 12 happy, amazing years together – years neither of them had dared hope for during the worst of the epidemic.</p><p>
“We were pillars standing among the ruins,” Ganymede said. That was what they told each other.</p><p>
Then Steven got sick.</p><p>
…</p><p>
At the turn of this century, these were hard lessons for the survivors of AIDS -- they’d lived, they’d made it through those awful early years of grief and fear, they had hope. And still, AIDS lurked, and it could strike again.</p><p>
The survivors were realizing, too, that they weren’t emerging from the rubble unscathed. Many had suffered permanent, disabling side effects from years of experimental drugs to keep HIV at bay. They had chronic pain and fatigue so profound that working a full-time job was unimaginable. Some had physical reminders -- scars from skin infections that had raged out of control, or cheeks that were hollowed and sagging from the wasting condition caused by AIDS.[g]</p><p>
In the early 2000s doctors were just starting to understand what a decade or more of  HIV infection did to the body. The virus could rear up suddenly in people who were long infected, and sometimes the new drugs couldn’t save them. The drugs themselves could damage the liver and kidney.</p><p>
Long-term exposure to HIV, even in those who never got sick, could cause the heart and other organs to age prematurely. Men who’d been diagnosed with HIV in the ‘80s were more vulnerable to diabetes and certain cancers.[h]</p><p>
And aside from the physical effects, AIDS left the survivors with psychological trauma that remains even now. As realization dawned that they were going to live, the survivors looked around and saw a landscape they didn’t recognize, marked by the devastation of their generation. They emerged from the epidemic not so much with hope and promise but fear and trepidation.</p><p>
Harry Breaux survived his bout with pneumocystis in 1996, but he was a changed man. He has a photo of himself from shortly after his hospitalization, when he went to visit his sister in Louisiana to recover. He’d lost nearly 60 pounds and in the photo, his face is gaunt, his frame sinewy like strings pulled tight on a guitar. He looks like he’s aged a decade.</p><p>
“I looked like a walking corpse,” Harry said.</p><p>
It would take him another decade to return to San Francisco. His body had held out long enough for him to get on the drugs that would save his life, but the life he’d left in the Castro was largely gone.[i]</p><p>
…</p><p>
After the first years of denial and terror about his HIV diagnosis, Jesus Guillen had reached a sort of peace and acceptance by the mid-1990s.</p><p>
His amnesty had been approved and he was on his way to becoming a U.S. citizen. He’d told his mom he had AIDS, and he was starting to open up to friends too. He’d moved to San Francisco, and he’d gone back to school.</p><p>
“Music, art, storytelling, dance. Communication with animals,” Jesus said, giving his cat, Mija, a grin and a rub. “I was just taking every class that sounded good to me.”[j]</p><p>
He lived long enough to go on antiretroviral therapy, and for a long time he was doing OK, aside from some mild neuropathy -- a numb vaguely tingling sensation in his leg -- from the HIV or the drugs.</p><p>
But in 2001 he found a lump in his neck and was diagnosed with lymphoma.</p><p>
“It can happen to many HIV-positive people,” Jesus said, although it’s possible that the infection and the cancer are unrelated.</p><p>
The treatment was undoubtedly made more brutal by his already weakened immune system. Every round of chemotherapy required hospitalization, usually in intensive care. After a year, he knocked back the cancer and avoided a resurgence of AIDS symptoms.</p><p>
But he was anxious all the time. He had trouble sleeping. For years since his cancer, he’s had a recurring nightmare in which he keeps trying to turn on a light but there is only darkness. All, Jesus says, are symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>
“I still take medication for anxiety,” Jesus said. “I’m not the kind of person to be depressed. But anxiety, I have it and I can’t stop it.”</p><p>
The cancer treatment also worsened his neuropathy, contorting it into a chronic pain that is now his primary disability. The pain is what’s kept him out of work for 15 years.</p><p>
Jesus has an easy, soft smile, and he holds himself somehow both still and fluid, like a dancer. His hair is often dyed -- a rich pink one day, platinum blond the next -- and his face is smooth, relaxed. When he first meets someone, Jesus doesn’t look like a man in pain.</p><p>
But over time -- over the course of a day -- the pain comes through in a tightness around his eyes and, most tellingly, the way he rubs his leg, firmly but absently, like he’s not aware he’s doing it. Nothing alleviates the pain entirely. Some days it drives him to tears.</p><p>
Jesus is a joyful man, he’s quick to say. He takes delight in simple pleasures, in seeking beauty in nature and making art and music. But he longs to feel useful. He wants to feel a part of his world and not just an observer.</p><p>
“I may not be able to have a 9 to 5 job, but believe me, I can do very good things. I can give something to society,” he says. “Let me do something. Let me be able to feel.”</p><p>
...</p><p>
Ralph Thurlow panicked when he was diagnosed with HIV. He’d worked for years in the early 1990s as a counselor to drug addicts and sex workers, advising them to protect themselves against AIDS. His own diagnosis came with a crush of shame and fear, and all he could think about was how he was going to tell his mom, and how badly he needed a drink.</p><p>
He’d been sober for more than a decade and an active member of a 12-step program in his Brooklyn neighborhood, but he couldn’t bear revealing his diagnosis to a group who knew him so well. Instead, he took the subway into Manhattan and found a predominantly gay group in Greenwich Village, where no one knew him, and he stood up and said it out loud. It wasn’t easy, and at the end of the meeting he still felt scared and alone.</p><p>
But a man walked up to him and said, “You’re going to be OK. You’re going to live.”</p><p>
That was 13 years ago, and Ralph has been with that man, David Spiher, ever since. They live in Hayward now, on a ranch-like property with dozens of animals -- chickens and turkeys, rats and guinea pigs, dogs and cats.</p><p>
It was 2002 when they met, and what David said that day was true enough -- by then people with AIDS were starting to live. David himself had lived with AIDS for nearly 20 years and survived even a bad bout of pneumocystis. </p><p>
He told Ralph he didn’t need a drink, and he didn’t have to tell his mother he had HIV. He told Ralph they were going to be fine.</p><p>
...</p><p>
New drug therapies saved lives, and they flooded the epidemic with a fresh rush of optimism. But for the men who’d already been sick for so long, who managed to live but not thrive, the post-drug years proved at times only how fragile the plague had left them. And how much AIDS could still take away.</p><p>
Losing Alain had been terrible, but Steven’s death in 2006 broke Ganymede’s heart in a way he couldn’t have anticipated. He and Steven had seen themselves as survivors. They’d made it to the other side and they were safe.</p><p>
But HIV, even after the antiretrovirals came out, could still grab hold, especially in those who’d been infected for so long. And when Steven got sick, Ganymede knew what was happening and where they were headed -- he’d been there before.</p><p>
When Steven died, Ganymede fell apart.</p><p>
His grief was so close to the surface that he found himself cracking at the slightest trigger. One day he went to the bank to pay off his house with money Steven had left him. The bank employee asked, with a bright smile, how it felt to own his home, and Ganymede burst into tears.</p><p>
“It feels horribly lonely,” he told her, and the woman had no response.</p><p>
...</p><p>
Any life is marked by a series of milestones. They’re notches, marks of the simple passage of time. But for a man with AIDS, those milestones sometimes took on profound significance.</p><p>
For a man diagnosed at age 25, reaching age 30 was a miracle. Some men never imagined they’d be around to celebrate the turn of the 21st century. Some just wanted one more Christmas.</p><p>
Fifty is a big number for a generation of men who couldn’t allow themselves to think more than a year or two into the future. It’s never easy for the young to imagine themselves old, but it’s impossible when the young never expect to grow up at all. </p><p>
Yet HIV is, by numbers alone, an older man’s disease in San Francisco now. More than half of the city’s HIV-positive people are 50 years or older. That’s cause for celebration -- these men weren’t expected to be here at all. But the city reached that threshold three years ago, mostly unremarked and entirely without fanfare.</p><p>
And for many of those men, 50 -- or 60 or even 70 -- hasn’t been easy.[k]</p><p>
Six years ago, Mick Robinson turned 50. That year, he emerged from a drug rehab program into a life that was terrifying precisely because he was going to live it.</p><p>
He was in Section 8 housing in the Tenderloin, he had no money and no job and few prospects for finding work. He was alone and isolated, and he felt too old for a gay community that so prominently valued youth and vitality.</p><p>
“By that time, they were saying this is a chronic illness and people with HIV are living as long a life as people who are negative,” Mick said. “And I thought, ‘Oh my God, what am I going to do?’”</p><p>
For nearly two decades, Mick had been twisting through cycles of addiction and sobriety. He’d picked up the meth habit again in San Francisco. Untreated mental health problems -- depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit disorder, anxiety -- made it near-impossible to stay clean and safe.</p><p>
The addiction and depression complicated his AIDS. In the thick of meth addiction, he’d forget to take his medication. Depression left him profoundly fatigued and unmotivated.</p><p>
Fifty was a crisis point. Mick sunk into a depression as deep and dark as any he could recall.</p><p>
He lived “like a zombie.” He’d stay in his home for days at a time, not bathing, not changing clothes, watching TV and barely eating. He stopped taking his HIV medication. Then one day, two years ago, he was clipping a toenail and he nicked a lesion that was growing there, unnoticed by him. Blood spurted all over. He dragged himself to a doctor.</p><p>
The lesion was Kaposi sarcoma --  something that HIV-positive people weren’t supposed to get anymore. His doctors were stunned.</p><p>
Mick woke up.</p><p>
…</p><p>
After Steven died, Ganymede stopped taking his antiretrovirals and braced against whatever future might come.</p><p>
“I had no will to live. No desire. I didn’t want to be here with so much sorrow and loss, and not just Steven, but the whole legacy of sorrow and loss,” he said. “I felt resentful that they all left, they got to be free of their pain.”</p><p>
When he finally spun out of his grief and decided he wanted to live again, his health was failing. He spent months in and out of the hospital in 2009. His immune system “was tanked,” and the process of restoring it was a long, painful ordeal. He still bears the marks of that illness and the treatment -- neuropathy that affects his balance and can make it difficult to walk, scars that cover his shins from feet to knees, from a cellulitis infection brought on by immunotherapy drugs.</p><p>
Slowly, though, he came back to life. He resumed relationships with old friends who had also survived the epidemic and reclaimed the house he’d shared with two dead lovers. In 2010, he was still resurfacing when he went to a party in San Francisco and met a man named Cullen[l][m].</p><p>
“By the end of the evening, I knew this was my next chapter,” Ganymede said.</p><p>
Cullen is sharp and abrasive and a troublemaker, prodding and poking others to test their reactions. Ganymede’s friends didn’t approve of him at first, protective after what he’d been through with Steven and Alain. But Ganymede was smitten.</p><p>
Two weeks after they met, Cullen moved into the Oakland home. Two years later, Cullen’s ex-lover, Warren, moved into the home with them. Ganymede and Cullen married in 2013, in a ceremony in their living room.</p><p>
“First I moved in my boyfriend. Then I moved in his ex-boyfriend,” Ganymede says with a laugh, sitting in the sun with Cullen and Warren, the three of them smoking cigarettes and marijuana and sipping iced tea. “Which does not even begin to describe the relationship. Now it’s family. We all love each other.”</p><p>
Cullen and Warren are HIV-positive too, though there’s a generational divide between Cullen and the others that’s marked by more than just age. Cullen became positive in 2005, when he was dating Warren. An HIV diagnosis in 2005 was nothing like what Ganymede experienced in 1986, or Warren in 1989. Cullen had never known anyone who’d died from the brutal infections that ravaged a body with AIDS.</p><p>
Now, there’s still a subtle but distinct difference between Cullen and the others, especially Ganymede, who so readily shares his grief. Cullen is strong and healthy and full of bravado. It takes Ganymede half an hour to get out of the bed in the morning, and when he walks down the stairs from the street to their home, he grips the side railing, moving his feet carefully one step at a time.</p><p>
Ganymede also worries about the future in a way that Cullen does not.</p><p>
“I live in fear that this time I will be the one who leaves behind a partner,” Ganymede says, and he begins to cry, quietly. “Having experienced that horrendous grief, I can’t imagine doing that to anyone I love.”</p><p>
…</p><p>
Ralph Thurlow didn’t try to talk David Spiher into moving with him to the Bay Area. He just told David he’d found a job there, and he hoped David would come too.</p><p>
David was resistant, attached to New York City, but he was in love and he didn’t need much convincing. They bought a house in Hayward. David got a job as an administrator at an Oakland private school. Ralph, who’d gone to veterinary school after his years as a counselor and social worker, was a surgeon caring for animals in a research lab. </p><p>
They were alive and they were healthy. They joined a new 12-step group, they made new friends, they started a new life.</p><p>
One night in early 2013 they were playing cribbage, just the two of them. In cribbage, players draw cards and add up points based on the face of their cards, and Ralph pulled a five and an eight. And he got stuck.</p><p>
David remembers asking him, “What’s five and eight?”</p><p>
He was met with a long silence.</p><p>
“Do you know what five and eight make?” David asked, gently.</p><p>
Ralph said, “Give me a minute.”</p><p>
“It took an inordinate time of my life, him not answering,” David says as they recall that day. Ralph is quiet.</p><p>
Later, Ralph would admit that he’d been struggling in the lab at work, needing a calculator to add grams as he measured drugs for his animals. He’d thought it was just age, or if it was something more serious, it wasn’t anything he wanted to think too hard about.</p><p>
He lost his job in October 2012, and at the time David thought it was just a layoff, just the economy, but in hindsight he wonders if Ralph wasn’t let go because his performance had slipped.</p><p>
They saw the first doctor in February 2013, and that kicked off a year and a half of testing and visits with specialists. It wasn’t until they happened upon a visiting doctor from the National Institutes of Health that they finally got an answer.</p><p>
Ralph had HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorder. HAND is a side effect of HIV, caused when the virus breaches the nervous system. Most people suffer relatively mild cognitive symptoms that can impair memory, language and decision making skills but still go about their daily lives. Ralph has a more severe form of it that causes dementia. It’s going to get worse.</p><p>
“His prognosis is five to seven years out,” David says. “It’s a really hard prognosis.”</p><p>
...</p><p>
The last time Peter Greene saw Jonathan Klein was at a small house party with a group of close friends. Jonathan seemed fine, maybe a little more outgoing than usual. That night, Peter didn’t notice anything off. Days, weeks, months later, he’d wonder what he missed.</p><p>
Peter woke up the morning after that party, on April 8, 2013, to an email from Jonathan, outlining his suicide plan. It was already too late. Peter called the police, and they found Jonathan’s car on the far side of the Golden Gate Bridge. Later, they found his body.</p><p>
Jonathan had never talked much about being HIV positive, not with Peter. But Peter believes that a lifetime of living with HIV played a part in his final decision. Jonathan had been distressed at growing older in what he perceived as a youth-obsessed gay culture.</p><p>
“He was so physical and so sexual, I think that played into it,” Peter said. “He didn’t want to talk about it, how it was this scarlet letter.”</p><p>
Peter had sold his stake in Now Voyager to Jonathan in the early ‘90s, but he stayed in an apartment above their storefront and helped with the business when he could. He and Jonathan remained close.</p><p>
Months before he died, Jonathan was booted out of his home, his landlord using the Ellis Act to buy him out. Peter offered to put him up and Jonathan moved in temporarily, but he was distraught about losing his home, anxious about where he’d live next.</p><p>
Only a few months later, they learned that their landlord was selling the building where Peter lived and Now Voyager was located. Jonathan was terrified that Peter was going to be homeless too. He became panicked and paranoid.</p><p>
“It just added to his fear and depression,” Peter said. “I would have talks with him every night: ‘Don’t worry, we’re going to figure it out.’”</p><p>
But they didn’t.</p><p>
Jonathan left Peter the business. But not long after his death, the building was sold. Peter was 58 years old, and in less than a year he’d lost his friend, he’d lost his home, and it looked like he’d lose the business, too.</p><p>
…</p><p>
The days leading up to this year’s Gay Pride Parade are warm and cloudless in the Castro.</p><p>
There’s a vibrancy to the neighborhood that is unique to the Castro, and this year, this Pride, the ebullience is made more pronounced by the anticipated same-sex marriage ruling by the Supreme Court. Early afternoon, and already music pours spills from the bars and into the sunlight. Young men walk hand in hand, lean close over restaurant tables, share indiscreet kisses out in the sun.</p><p>
The survivors walk among them, gray-haired and carrying their immeasurable burden. The signs of what they’ve endured are subtle and are easily overlooked — gaunt cheeks, a stiffness to their walk that belies chronic pain — and some bear no visible scars at all. But most notable may be that even on a sunny day, amid the celebrants of a particularly joyful Pride, they are dispirited.</p><p>
Harry Breaux stands at the corner of Market and Castro streets, waving over tourists and distributing maps and brochures. He tells them which building once held Harvey Milk’s camera shop, suggests they stop by the GLBT History Museum. He gives them directions to the Haight and the Mission.</p><p>
Later, Harry walks a few blocks up Castro, and back down. He doesn’t live in the neighborhood. He could never afford it. His pride -- in the Castro, and the history and generation it still represents to him -- is earnest and intense. But it’s not home, not anymore.</p><p>
“I’m living this life, I’m in it, but I’m not of it,” Harry says. “The people that have shared that with me are dead.”[n]</p><p>
...</p><p>
Kevin VandenBergh’s apartment is on Market Street overlooking the Castro. Windows in the living room and kitchen provide wide, sweeping views of San Francisco Bay and the Oakland Hills, and on a clear day he can see Mount Diablo poking above the distant skyline. But Kevin shrugs off the view, barely aware of it.</p><p>
Though he spends most of his days, sometimes every hour of the day, in the apartment, the only obvious signs of his presence in the shared living room are a stack of DVDs of TV shows that he likes and mementos of his cat, Truman, who died a year and a half ago. On a shelf sits a framed photo of Truman, and in a corner stands Truman’s tall, carpeted play structure.</p><p>
Kevin is desperately lonely. AIDS activists and health care providers say isolation may be the most widespread problem among long-term survivors of AIDS, and the hitch is that no one knows how to determine just how many people are affected -- how many men are sitting alone in a home they almost never leave, feeling, still, like they’re just waiting to die.</p><p>
Truman’s death hit Kevin harder than any friend he lost during the epidemic. Truman had been his closest and constant companion. He’d talked to Truman and shared his life with him. When Truman died, Kevin thought he might die too. He thought he had nothing left to live for.</p><p>
Kevin has a hard time meeting new people, and an even harder time developing relationships. He’s nervous and fidgety when he talks, and he has a tendency to over-share, only to withdraw and isolate again when he becomes self-conscious.</p><p>
Kevin’s mental health has proved far more challenging than his physical health, even after living more than half of his life with HIV. Depression is a near-constant shadow, and though he is in therapy through a free city program, it isn’t helping, he says.</p><p>
He feels stuck, as though he’s stunted or arrested, like time stopped for him with his HIV diagnosis.</p><p>
He worries almost endlessly about money. He will collect the private disability he got from working in his 20s and 30s until he’s 65, but after that he’ll go on Social Security and his income will be cut in half, to about $1,600 a month. Though he has nine years to figure out a solution, already he feels paralyzed by fear. He doesn’t know how he’ll afford an apartment or food.</p><p>
“I feel like my life has been a total waste,” Kevin says, his voice steady and firm as he sits in the apartment, bathed in afternoon light. “I’ve accomplished nothing. I have nothing to offer.”</p><p>
Kevin considers suicide. He has a plan.</p><p>
…</p><p>
Suicide has been a killer of people with AIDS since the beginning. In those horrifying early years, men would hoard drugs -- painkillers, usually -- to end things themselves before AIDS could take its gruesome toll. Some men would throw themselves farewell parties.</p><p>
But the suicides didn’t stop after the antiretrovirals came along and AIDS was no longer a death sentence. In San Francisco now, more people with HIV die from suicide than they do of AIDS.</p><p>
The reasons are complicated. Among the newly infected, HIV tends to go hand-in-hand with emotional and physical trauma, and suicide may have nothing to do with the diagnosis but instead all of the other chaos in a difficult life.</p><p>
The long-term survivors have suffered incredible loss and grief. They’ve been traumatized. They lack a safety net of friends and family. They worry about money, about losing their home, about feeling connected to a city that’s long moved past them.</p><p>
The first step to helping, to bringing them back into the fold of their community, is acknowledgment, say survivors and their advocates. That’s happening in some small ways.</p><p>
The San Francisco AIDS Foundation started a social club for people 50 and older last year. The members -- most, but not all, of whom have HIV or AIDS -- meet weekly for dinner and to talk about their shared experiences and fears. For some, it’s their only shared meal of the week.</p><p>
Other groups host weekend retreats for people affected by AIDS, although they’re not often marketed specifically to long-term survivors. Harry Breaux works with The Billys, a social club of gay men that is open to all ages but dominated by the older guys. Just before the Pride Parade, the Shanti Project and a loose group of volunteers held a dance for AIDS survivors -- they repeated it a few months later, in October.</p><p>
These clubs and retreats and dances are meant to draw people out of their homes and back into a life outside. They’re meant to rebuild a generation. But the survivors themselves are doing most of that rebuilding, and they’re weary.</p><p>
“In the ‘90s we all kind of went into isolation. You lost your friends and all of a sudden you’re alone. Coming out of that is not easy,” Harry says. “I’m running into what I call the leftovers -- people like me, who are starting the gatherings, the groups, the potlucks.”</p><p>
They need help, he says.[o]</p><p>
...</p><p>
After Jonathan Klein died and Peter Greene was kicked out of his own home, Peter relocated to Palm Springs, where a community of older gay men was coalescing and life was more affordable.</p><p>
His friends -- led by Eileen Glutzer -- helped him buy a mobile home for $60,000. Back in San Francisco, a long-time client of Now Voyager who owned several properties in the Castro offered Peter a low-rent storefront on 19th Street. Peter could keep the business open, and for a while he ran it from his home now 500 miles away.</p><p>
But losing his apartment was a terrible blow, the repercussions of which still linger, two years later. He had to pack up his home of nearly 30 years, scattering the belongings he couldn’t take with him among friends in San Francisco.</p><p>
“I was banished from the kingdom I knew,” Peter said. “San Francisco is in my heart.”</p><p>
While he’s living on a fixed income -- just $1,200 a month in Social Security disability -- Peter can’t imagine how he’ll find a permanent new home in San Francisco. Since this past summer, he has been living with Glutzer, trying to figure out if he can keep the business going and, just maybe, move back to the city he loves.</p><p>
At times, it’s like he’s never left. He has the same doctors, volunteers for the same hospice that he’s been with for years.</p><p>
Once or twice a week he goes to Martuni’s, a Market Street piano bar, and sings with the same crowd, with a pianist who’s close as family. Peter is the kind of person who’s shy at a party but loves the spotlight, and standing beside a piano, microphone in hand, he’s charming, his voice smooth and easy.</p><p>
But survival is hard. Peter calls himself the “luckiest unlucky person in the world,” because he’s alive and he has dear friends who love and support him, but his grief can become unbearable. His future -- his home and his income, his work and his health -- is full of uncertainty.</p><p>
Glutzer asks him one afternoon, as they’re discussing death and coming to terms with dying, if he thinks he might be better prepared for the end than she is. He’s not so sure. He’s already outlived almost all of his friends, and the irony is that he’s now outliving even those who never had HIV — who are now dying of cancer or heart disease or whatever else takes down people as they age.</p><p>
“For me, the HIV story is full of woe, but I don’t want that to be the message,” Peter says. “There was suffering. But you can see, I’m having a nice day. And this is the moment, and we’re all walking, talking, eating. We can go traveling again. Hopefully there’s more of that.”</p><p>
But he admits that living more than half his life with a death sentence has forced him to live as most people probably don’t. To grasp the moment. To embrace what is precious.</p><p>

Jesus Guillen’s home is his sanctuary. It’s a quirky, third-floor unit in Hayes Valley, with a chaotic floorplan that’s a maze of rooms, like a museum or gallery. Jesus’s art is everywhere, on every wall in every room. His mother has brought him art from Mexico, too, and he’s put plants in the corners, a water feature in the living room.</p><p>
He’s lived there 14 years. He worries constantly about losing it. He could never afford another place that feels like home.</p><p>
And he worries about being alone. It’s just Jesus and Mija, his cat, in the apartment. If Jesus gets sick again -- a return of the cancer or something AIDS-related, or pain that somehow gets worse -- he doesn’t know who will take care of him.</p><p>
He knows he should have a living will and someone appointed his medical power of attorney, to make tough decisions about his care. His mother lives too far away. It seems like too much responsibility to put on a friend, even a very good one.</p><p>
“I keep thinking a partner should do that,” Jesus says. “And I don’t have a partner now.”</p><p>
He dates now and then. Some men are put off by the HIV, others don’t seem to mind. But he thinks that he may carry too much baggage. He knows some men will be deterred by HIV, by cancer, by his chronic pain and the limitations that puts on his life. He says he’s willing to wait, as long as he has to, for someone who will see him and take him for exactly who he is.</p><p>
But his voice, soft and melodic, falters as he goes on.</p><p>
“I like to think I am a good person. I have good things to offer a person. But definitely I’m not a simple person,” he says. Falling in love, finding a partner, “It’s something I want very much, very badly.”</p><p>

Ralph Thurlow has good days and bad. Some days no one but David Spiher could tell there was anything off about him. Other days, Ralph clearly struggles for words as he speaks, clutches at memories that have become twisted or vanished altogether.</p><p>
Ralph is able to drive and to shop, to clean the house and take care of their animals. But in June, he lost his car keys somewhere in the house and they still haven’t found them. That same month, David realized that Ralph had stopped cooking lunch for himself because he was afraid of leaving the oven on and starting a fire.</p><p>
“He’ll want a cup of coffee, so he gets a cup of coffee,” David says, smiling fondly as they sit together in the studio space that David, a long-time artist, rents in Emeryville. Ralph will get his coffee, set it on a table, and forget about it.  “And all of a sudden there’s five cups of coffee in the house. They’re scattered around in the yard and in the house.”</p><p>
Some of those are David’s, Ralph insists. David just laughs and shakes his head.</p><p>
They’re an odd couple, something they both acknowledge and enjoy. David carries himself loose and casual, though he’s got the spit and fire of a New Yorker in him. He’s also the worrier. He’s taken ownership of Ralph’s medical care and he worked months to get him on disability. To deal with his stress, David paints. He’s produced a collection of portraits and scenes from their life, splashy, colorful oils that are painful and beautiful.</p><p>
Ralph is small and compact, his eyes sharp and serious behind glasses. He’s quiet until he’s not, and then he’ll tell his life story, slipping in wry, funny details without cracking a smile.</p><p>
He calls David grumpy, and David agrees.</p><p>
David spent most of his life convinced AIDS would kill him. After he was diagnosed, he left his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, because he didn’t want to die there at age 26. Years later, in New York City, he didn’t think he’d outlive his 15-year-old dog.</p><p>
He’s seen miracles. His own life, that he’s here at all, is amazing. If doctors are saying Ralph could be dead in five years, well, David was supposed to be dead too. He knows science can save lives, and he has to hope that if they both fight hard enough science will come through again.</p><p>
“So on some level I don’t lose heart,” David says. “I can’t decide for myself that it’s over and done.”[p]</p><p>

Some days, Ganymede struggles to get up from a chair, his partners watching him. They don’t jump up to help, knowing he’ll brush them off. His body is stiff, painful. Cullen and Warren do almost all of the cooking and cleaning, and Ganymede can’t help but feel useless in his own home.</p><p>
His libido has faded too, and he misses the sexual closeness that was once so key to his spirituality, though he’s found comfort in a gentler sort of physical intimacy.</p><p>
“I’m 59, but I feel closer to 70,” Ganymede says. But every morning, he wakes up and he reminds himself that he’s here and so many others are not. “I get to go through the awful process of aging with this disease that literally 100 of my friends never got to do. As bad as it is, they never got the chance to do even this.”</p><p>
Falling in love all over again wasn’t easy, Ganymede says, but he believes it’s inevitably worth it.</p><p>
“I’ve been so blessed. I had so much passion and joy and happiness, and the price has been terrible sorrow and loss,” he says. “I’m certainly willing to pay that price.”</p><p>
Ganymede is soft-voiced but firm, his long hair pulled back into a loose ponytail, a ring through his nose. He exudes a quiet but insistent energy, an undeniable authority. He’s the orbital center of his family in the hills.</p><p>
His friends call him “St. Ganymede,” Cullen says with a fond eyeroll.</p><p>
The three of them are magnets for disaster, they like to joke.</p><p>
“One of our phrases is, ‘May the light from our burning bridges illuminate your path forward,’” Ganymede says with a laugh.</p><p>

The San Francisco Model of care still thrives, but its course has changed direction dramatically since the advent of drugs to treat AIDS. For most of the agencies that still exist, the focus is on prevention and on getting those who test positive immediately into care. Providing services for the sick and dying is no longer a priority -- there just aren’t enough clients.</p><p>
San Francisco General Hospital closed its inpatient AIDS wards. The outpatient Ward 86 still bustles with activity, but it’s a pleasant, eager sort of hum. The patients, young and old, expect to be around for a long time. Last year, San Francisco announced a new campaign to end AIDS and HIV entirely. Public health authorities are pushing prevention and treatment, testing and education.</p><p>
Long-term survivors say they understand that the epidemic has changed. But they wonder where they exist in this new model. Their needs are starting to become clearer.</p><p>
Men need mental health care -- support groups and access to therapists who understand their unique histories. They need help with housing and with other costs of living. And they need to rebuild their community.</p><p>
Mick Robinson is trying to do just that.</p><p>
He’s three years sober now. He’s on medications to control his HIV and his depression, and though he still battles the darkness, there’s far more light these days.</p><p>
For someone without a job and living on disability, he’s a busy man. Mick is head of the tenants’ council for his apartment complex, a member of a city task force on HIV and aging, and an enthusiastic participant in several social groups for long-term survivors of AIDS.</p><p>
He’s taking classes at San Francisco State University and San Francisco City College -- one on leadership, one on peer counseling for mental health and addiction. He’s building a career in advocacy and public policy.</p><p>
At 56, he’s learning to accept, and even embrace, that he’s still got a lot of life ahead of him.</p><p>
“I’m a very happy individual, probably happier than I’ve ever been,” Mick says.</p><p>
In his one-room apartment in the Tenderloin, on the edge of Civic Center Plaza, the bed takes up most of the living space. Beside it is a framed photo of Mick’s dog, a border collie mix that died nine years ago, and pictures of ex-boyfriends and old friends.</p><p>
A portrait of his mother stands among a collection of wooden boxes like a shrine in the middle of the room. His mother is 86 now, and after she spent so many years worrying over him and wondering if the AIDS or the drugs or the depression would kill him, Mick is happy to be nothing but a source of pride these days.</p><p>
“In some ways I look at HIV as giving me purpose,” he says. “It certainly was an anchor and chain for a while.”</p><p>
E, Joanie return removed for length. She still exists in original and I have her on save string.[q][r][s][t]</p><p>
... </p><p>
Kevin VandenBergh walked into St. John the Evangelical Church before the music had started. It was a warm Thursday night, and the first guests were just starting to arrive for a casual dance organized by the Shanti Project for long-term survivors of AIDS</p><p>
Kevin had decided to go on a whim and he was nervous, hands shaking, talking a bit too fast. Before the dance was a barbecue dinner, and before Kevin could change his mind and run home, a man he’d met once or twice before took him by the arm and steered him to a table to sit and eat. Within minutes, he’d convinced Kevin to march with the Shanti contingent in the San Francisco Pride Parade a few days later. </p><p>
By the time the dance started, Kevin’s head was spinning and he was feeling shaky and over-stimulated, but successful in his outing nonetheless. He’d said yes -- he’d ventured outside his quiet, lonely life. He left the dance and began heading home after only an hour or so, and he was halfway down the block when a familiar song came on and he stopped.</p><p>
It was “I Will Survive.” It’s almost embarrassing how fitting that song was for him, he admits with a mall smile, but “it’s a great song.” He used to dance to it at the Chicago clubs in the early ‘80s, when it first came out.</p><p>
So he returned to the dance, and more than three hours later he was one of only a handful of men still there when the lights came up.</p><p>
Three days later he marched in the Pride parade, carrying a banner saying “Love Heals.”</p><p>
...</p><p>
Under a fat summer sun that’s baking the Financial District, Harry Breaux is wearing fishnet stockings and a black corset, and he’s carefully eating a popsicle.</p><p>
The Pride Parade started two hours ago but Harry’s marching with Shanti and they’re at the tail end. They’ve been waiting out in the sun, sweating and trying to stay hydrated. Someone bought him the treat to help him keep cool. Harry’s feet are sore and his back aches but he doesn’t want to sit because it might ruin his costume, so he leans against a tree.</p><p>
Last year, Harry barely roused the energy to sit on a bus with other current and former Shanti volunteers in the parade. This June, he’s fierce.</p><p>
He’s costumed as a character from The Rocky Horror Picture Show, recreating the last parade he marched in, in 1990, before he dropped out of San Francisco and the Castro and the culture of AIDS. He’d dressed up for that parade too, singing and dancing all along the route, his performance captured in a photo that ran on the front page of the Bay Area Reporter.</p><p>
Harry spent several weeks putting together the costume for the 2015 parade. He shaved his beard. He took his time dressing that morning and took Muni to the staging area, singing to passengers along the way. When he reached the parade, when he found the group of long-term survivors he’d be leading down Market Street, he held tight to a friend and wept quietly.</p><p>
He’s reconnecting with the remains of his generation -- finding other survivors at social clubs and informal support groups -- and sometimes the reunions can be bittersweet. It’s not always easy to exchange their stories, to talk about their shared history. But it’s a relief to have people to share it with at all.</p><p>
Harry doesn’t know why he survived when so many others did not. But he feels a compulsion now to share his story and to show his face -- to make himself known. And he’s finding that people are watching and listening. They want to hear what he has to say.</p><p>
It’s hard, sometimes, to be a spokesman for a generation. “I’m nothing special here,” he says, “except that I lived.”</p><p>
But most days, he knows, having lived is what counts.</p><p>
…</p><p>
Kevin met a man at the survivors dance. And at the parade, he and John marched together, holding opposite ends of the banner. Kevin was screaming and laughing the whole time, waving at the crowds, his face lit up in a grin.</p><p>
After the parade they were swallowed by the crowds at Civic Center Plaza. Kevin reached for John, so they wouldn’t lose each other.</p><p>
“And all of a sudden I realized, we were holding hands,” Kevin says. It’s weeks later and his eyes are bright. “I can’t tell you the last time I held someone’s hand.”</p><p>
Kevin met with his therapist shortly after Pride, and the counselor asked him if he’d be able to hang on to the positive energy he’d tapped into. Kevin has struggled with that in the past, his therapist reminded him.</p><p>
“And I said, ‘I have to. I have to. I have to let all this stuff in, these people. I need to stay open to it,’” Kevin says. “But it’s so scary.”</p><p>

David Spiher proposed to Ralph Thurlow in late 2013. Ralph responded with a quick and sincere no. He knew too many people with terrible marriages, he said. But the following February, Ralph proposed -- on Valentine’s Day, no less.</p><p>
He’d forgotten to buy a gift, David says with a grin.</p><p>
Ralph says he doesn’t remember that.</p><p>
The wedding was July 25. The ceremony was simple, on a sunny afternoon at a zen center in Berkeley where they both practice Buddhism. They married in front of 50 or so friends and family — a contingent from New York, Ralph’s sister and niece, David’s coworkers. The grooms wore matching white tunics and pants, and beads around their necks.</p><p>
David gently guided Ralph through parts of the ceremony, whispering reminders to bow or turn, to grasp hands during the vows. Ralph might just have been nervous. His memory might have been fine.</p><p>
In the corner was a three-tiered cake, frosted brown like the mountains around Yosemite Valley, a place they both love. Over one side spilled a frosted blue waterfall, and perched close to the edge was a cake topper made just for them. An artist friend designed a 3D printed sculpture of David and Ralph in a rowboat, bodies leaned in close, hands grasping each other’s knees. The boat dangled over the side of the waterfall, facing against the current -- their backs to the turbulent, unknown future.</p><p>
These are not young men, said the zen master who married them, as he began the service. The crowd chuckled, and the grooms, both now 56, smiled too.</p><p>
Turned serious, the zen master said, “These are two men who have lived a life, who understand the sadness and the suffering that’s connected with the deep well of love and passion.”</p><p>
“Probably the most important thing in a marriage is to be big enough to hold everything. If we can hold it then we’re not afraid of it,” he said. “Please, in your marriage, hold your whole experience. All of it.”</p><p>
Acknowledge and reflect on the largeness of life, the zen master said. Then live it, day to day, breath to breath.</p><p>
“Will you?” the zen master said.</p><p>
“Yes, we can,” David said, eyes on Ralph, a soft, private smile on his face.</p><p>
The zen master frowned. “You can?”</p><p>
David grinned. “We do.”</p><p>
In a life defined by a plague and measured in loss and pain, in fear and loneliness, sometimes it’s the minutes, the seconds that matter. Like an oath of marriage, sealed with one perfect kiss.</p>
